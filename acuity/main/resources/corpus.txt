extremely poorly built gap flapper not close well also plastic clamp included not long enough ended not using product
heat going house especially degree crazy no device great easy clean warms basement
saving energy venting electric dryer house generally good idea however product poor choice due cheap construction summer position leak significant amount hot moist air house causing extra load air conditioning leaking air due flap leaving almost inch gap summer position winter position flag also poor seal believe using product would increase energy consumption not lower must better product available one found much better deflecto ex heat saver lint trap

hoping benefit warm dryer air winter keeping cold winter air piece broke fell dryer first minute even massive amount duct tape two clamp product would barely stay place letting even cold air without not eco friendly
one year ago lived iowa unable locate one local store since moving idaho doesn make sense run furnace humidifier one end house pipe warm moist air outside end excessive humidity house never problem neck wood especially winter not use gas dryer though carbon monoxide could kill two problem simple solve first screen exhaust fill rather quickly dryer lint simply cut screen mount nylon stocking hole superior filter hold large amount dryer lint safely second unit no plate mounting wall used wall anchor attach cable tie worked fine
use close dryer winter month used cover filter avoid cold air comming vent little neater vent basement careful gas dryer avoid carbon monoxide
every thing though would keep kitchen nice warm cat love lol
great item installed ten minute running dryer two cycle warmed basement ten degree measured temperature coming vent one hundred degree pleased item made cheep providing free heat wise would lose lint trap easy clean

make best little part door inside set door closed air go outside summer winter turn door degree warm air stay house second little door center bigger door screen get clogged air sill open small door allow vent go outside
not seal well summer winter setting particular concern would summer setting want hot moist air go outside house unit not seal well cover plastic summer might well change summer winter mode manually
seems work pretty well took minute install included finding step ladder switch bit flimsy not horrid not going heat whole house even basement every little bit help better pumping hot air backyard note gravity flap plastic flap assume case let lint filter get clogged however doesn take much pressure flap pushed mean heated air going escape outside no matter position switch would not suggest taping flap though don shocked cold morning see little heated air coming outside dryer vent

got today installed tossed load wet clothes dryer turned damper set blow house wow never realized much heat wasted blowing hole wall never seen one working like heating vent forced air furnace actual construction whole thing pretty cheap couple ear molded onto would nice screwing place wall drilled hole inside back secured place couple screw seems sturdy enough guess time tell
one couldn find replacement like heat blowing house winter
made plastic not best vent owned pretty good job redirecting drier air outside summer month inside laundry room winter month
product help put moisture back air house winter help heat also
add moisture air winter switch outside summer save energy good job
product say conserving heat humidity inside house winter exhausting summer easy install included clamp two year use haven issue lint dust noticed although summer setting seems tight significant amount air escape past valve winter setting would guess fourth air escape exterior winter mean don see saving hoped look bright side still saving warm humid air would buy product however would prefer product better quality even cost
one similar not many year finally died handle snapping one plastic clamp biting dust handle allows choose dryer air put old stocking front don trust rather wide grating filter grab fine dust screw metal clamp bought tightened almost end seems like unit bit narrower old one fit btw great gizmo add bit humidity heated basement get dry winter using dryer air directed turn one humidifiers
installed baby recently owned awhile sat box found many reviewer said side entry point dryer venting tube not tight fit tried use zip tie provided uhh guy not clamp don even go entire distance around tube since product basically jammed venting coming dryer venting outside house duct taped around edge no zip tie required one thing found fact little flapper unit not attached yup didn figure thing installed take apart reach snap place someone else recommended put used dryer sheet behind removable lint filter thing open day two got super hot mid west venting outside look forward lint free way enjoy heat creating winter dryer update thing change get pay
another brand used year screen finally broke like one screen come easily old one sold national hardware chain don like one liked old one quality gap seam not dryer exhaust directed heat keeper leak seam leak outside another criticism screen not fine reason harder clean dryer filter neither device nor old one great job containing dust lint lint catching bag might able tied exhaust one haven tried really like see device like used keep heat house would filter dryer exhaust water must cleaner solution keeping heat house
product shipped fast surprised quality better thought especially going price also easy install work advertised easy switch run dryer heat cold flip switch hot love product
product work good kinda difficult mount non flexible duct used duct tape mount solid ducting work fine
installed minute using metal clamp instead chintzy zip tie came followed advise review put nylon stocking vent extra lint catching work good think worth price paid
simple piece plastic work make sure clean every dryer load screen blow form pressure
ok work fine removable filter ok run dryer hose dryer second hose back exit note no hole mount drill several get mounted drywall isn great look nice laundry room versus basement hidden one however good efficiency heat would wasted otherwise also screen great job keeping lint living area
handy thing cool dry basement construction descent could stand little tighter fit plastic seems little considering half price walmart lowes won complain
needed replace similar type unit square square closure flap don recall name unit much better design thoroughly thought design use flap unit locked place control set lever shown photo lock open closed problem unit flap would fall dryer load would reset plus unit came two nylon closure flex line highly recommend
kitty living make garage floor wet area perhaps condensation drastic change temperature
bought unit insert dryer exhaust tubing order switch much better indoor lint trap filter also ordering outside exhaust port without using included screen review dundas unit not good enough use exclusively filter trap diverter yes great idea exhaust heated air better lint filter basement winter exhaust heated air outdoors summer simply turning lever great idea defeated manufacturer improved unit making large hole diverter flap prevent blow back thus defeating purpose fix problem cut round disc plastic lid glued onto flap trip local hardware store ducting revealed better made unit sans flap hole lower price no shipping unit serf intended purpose albeit greater expense work
exactly pictured easy work though buy metal clamp since im not fond plastic one
great item help moisturizing winter time added heat basement make laundry winter much easier
yes rather item better made higher quality part material however le device job easy install suggestion output screen push wish longer could attach hose go better filter screen one come work pain clean everytime good device certainly save u money
want cheap easy way heat room humidify int winter thing great dryer teh kitchen thing super warm dryer running
product say let reclaim heat drier easy install price hard beat seller packed well shipped fast
installs minute not necessarily easy ducting issue behind dryer dryer need carefully pulled not pull apart ducting great idea although somewhat kluge effect work well advised need fan utility room order move air confined space larger room would not need help
work great remember install device right direction arrow unit direct also might better bought two inch metal screw clamp hardware store rather using plastic tie send unit went lowes bought another section exhaust tubing make device rise dryer anchored wall also cut material c filter exact shape filter screen better air filtration nice device cheap anything good luck
order make sure no lint got house added extra home made filter onto exhaust filter thrilled result lot heat house no lint excess moisture everyone house different moisture level may problem took hosiery knee high stocking cut sock portion elasticized portion part hold knee high near knee perfect size fitting around product filter sewed shut cut end scrape lint stocking product filter every day no problem lot free heat
poorly engineered manufactured mine arrived broken tab tiny tiny tab whose purpose may serve aid manufacturing assembly weak keep clamshell style half together tab dramatically engineered either failed shipping didn survive assembly factory good thing product come tie wrap attach dryer hose need keep product unhinging pressure relief feature silly second flap middle flap feature activates lightest puff air completely compromising seal generous suggesting part product actually align properly make choice directing majority air either indoors moot unless disable nd flap e duct tape air go want biggest problem no pride work not design not engineering not manufacture product appears compromised committee bean counter maximize profit not deliver quality product value
device easy install however better using metal clamp included plastic one others said included screen terrible filtering use old piece nylon stocking instead not use small enclosed room increased moisture coat everything condensation either wait minute much moisture exit house open door laundry room
worked great dryer center house helped mounting ok opened screwed cabinet closed add tube
heat keeper handy damper make easy direct warm moist air electric clothes dryer home cold outside also easy flip flap send outside summer imagine much expensive moist air could saved recycled reused cold winter month isn government
really easy install took minute spent wrestling drier hose since air already vented laundry room no issue summer come around may take product unit gap plastic may husband seal caulking may remove warmer weather since live arid climate product perfect keep back house warm drier going add much needed humidity air climate aren desert cautious put good amount humidity don feel bad using drier rather drying rack using product
start saying live arizona even get pretty cold winter winter also tend fairly dry especially using artificial heat house vent two thing first add heat house second add much needed moisture air several load laundry warmth moisture noticeable much appreciated complaint actual construction unit leaf something desired plastic gap air deflector not fit tight would like appreciate able capture warm moist air might otherwise lost outside winter overall good not great product would buy couldn find something built better yes
despite non glowing review read bought anyway shoddy construction sure several review mentioned screen not contain lint busting scissors pair tights realized needed attached cut tight end vent rubber band promptly packed un needed heat keeper june hit reattach vent outside wall
one dryer system year not heat effective blow lint dust back laundry area not worth trouble
inch foot duct not come stated description would bought elsewhere would known
work however cheaply made leak ton air valve suppose vent air outside obviously don want summer cool weather though ok work best vent first min air outside due high moisture let rest directed back house
great idea no rubber seal valve allow air leak past closed door either position different valve sealed much better overall still good idea suggest covering screen something stop air leaking house supposed go outsied
handy little gadget put heat back house filtering lint ten buck think well worth price check
people cry quality dryer vent also seen removed lot cheaper one like one big box store little clumsy work great exactly described little flap main flap blow extra pressure like screen build lint seal edge silicon duct sealant don like minor leak flap move lock well plastic housing sufficiently thick worried influence outside air use outside vent like lambro heartland dryer going leak air either way unless use something close outside completely difference notice junction notice dryer thing happens regardless not device fault
purchased menards promptly returned basically cheap two piece make housing don form hermetic seal not use foil tape duct seal installed rather quickly sealed thing well test run noticed warm moist air blowing right vent granted much air deflected outside better dumping air house also felt lint screen inadequate mesh isn fine enough catch small piece lint make vent screen really might well not even back remove duct outside vent point inward winter plug exterior vent insulation
husband installed super quick exactly say oil heat expensive don want waste heat going house dryer vent run basement great extra heat course mean keep laundry lol
wife love product northeast winter last long time product put heat water back house item want house button cold month arrived within day ordering would buy deep six plastic clamp purchase metal local hardware use nylon stocking instead sreening
bad house allow moisture house cause mold build moisture window problem hook gas drier also get carbon dioxide house really want moisture house don use fan take shower shouldn need humidty house cook bath breath
basically plastic box flap valve inside put little super glue joint pressed together tightly liked look little better rounded back not designed mount wall anyway drywall screw valve flap move easily also mini flap center vlave flap dryer doesn blow hard house clamp come aren best finally paid hose clamp hardware store guy really hold tight used hate feeling seeing steamy air streaming house like watching dollar blowing away item seems like good fix problem future electric bill tell
installed quickly cut section existing vent placed slid vent valve simple flap directs air outside circular opening inside turn dryer heat garage quickly good product
find dundas heat diverter work designed yes lightweight come apart little tweaking well worth cheap cost installation screwed wall biggest complaint people screen allowing lint go solution pull screen cap place used dryer sheet opening put cap back got second finer screen two us dryer sheet length twice diameter dispose moisture accumulation laundry room no problem well heated ventilated area moist hot air plenty opportunity disperse contribute comfort gas heat going plenty good use moisture win win summer come probably bypass whole thing connecting flex tube making sure heat go outside yes flap coverage would use metal screw hose clamp tubing maximum fit also help pull plastic housing together
front screen not quite fine enough stop lint leaking stretch one nude knee high filter exit act finer filter nude shade make easier see knee high need cleaned replaced trap smallest lint particle not interfer exhaust flow
first let start saying product extremely poorly made secondly advertised coming includes inch foot proflex ul dryer transition duct wasn anywhere found made thin plastic part not fit together well open seam allow air lint escape room damper also poorly made allows air escape unit closed duct isn effective another negative aspect device no mounting bracket fixture keeping wall please consider going cost mounting bracket additional duct work better clamp come zip tie product doesn work effectively guess figured sending back refund
great idea used good effect unfortunately particular device essentially air valve poorly manufactured required repair could used plastic shell flimsy two piece snap together affair didn snap together well thus leaving interior valve flap warped shell not allow valve flap seat properly either position repaired modified mine work properly remain annoyed product required pre installation repair straight box came clamp provided actually plastic wire tie inadequate hold dryer hose pressure buy real set hose clamp install item use duct tape keep vent hose place screen small rapidly become clogged lint get dryer lint screen install device easily access screen removal cleaning strongly suggest purchase different brand device note use electric dryer
paying heat anyway not heat house price great job yes plastic want screen not capture lint cause dusting fixed placing cut fit piece cheese cloth outlet covered screen feel air flow diminish running dryer simply remove clean lint piece cheese cloth put back vent outlet screen top every load laundry no big deal like removing lint dryer screen not experienced moisture issue others said using two year would definately recommend friend
work described mentioned review called zip tie not work no idea suppose hold tension slapped real zip tie holding great screen isn fine could use better filter lint would recommend price someone trying conserve energy recycle heat dryer back house
please heat keeper placed dryer instead heating laundry room time heat dry clothes wonderful product highly recommend
like idea product designed poorly get pay one could useful modify doesn leak fit standard size dryer hose better cheaply made product inlet outlet small properly fit aluminum flex duct rigid duct leak around connection may able get fit one cheap aluminum foil flex duct crank hose clamp really hard probably still leak forget using included clamp basically nylon zip tie valve closed vent outside good amount air still leak plastic flapper vent inside home dump extra heat humidity home summer want vent outdoors no gasket sealing valve cheap plastic save money home depot lowes sell something similar cheap however buy store least return easily without paying return shipping

poor quality item didn work properly dryer would not recommend
opinion duct sold absolutely useless piece junk duct bottom collar short attached dryer exhaust line duct attached vertical position likely intended configuration stem stay flat back bulge dryer cabinet drum location collar far dryer exhaust connected longer duct connection collar either manufactured supplied optional adjustable part could make device usable

little machine awesome definately worth money homework portable washer one seemed one could find spin cycle point washing machine hand wring clothes single apartment dweller little wahser perfect size apartment would definately reccommend friend family find portable electric dryer size p mine play jingle bell funny

washer good paid bought wash baby clothes get job done water hose fill machine short move closer sink every time laundry no wheel also manufacturer made two adjustable leg instead one level machine since small easily balanced think machine good especially underware baby clothes small thing easy use not good manual figure use first time see long last far used three time
adorable little washing machine like toy grown work absolutely perfect tiny nyc apartment dweller take no space whatsoever work great despite smallness take nice load clothes parent bigger version like kid never run sock spend hour laundromat precious saturday insanely overwhelming pile laundry price steal seriously beat spending buck everytime laundromat highly recommended
satisfied little washing machine clothes come great little nervous buying particular washing machine reading review people said constantly rebalance load spin cycle nervous machine run fine think maybe machine not level uneven floor adjust machine make level spin cycle work great stay balanced even wash heavy towel thing don like machine empty lint filter every load laundry no big deal though quick clean still would nice didn need cleaned every time oh also not problem leak took one person advice review said not use much laundry detergent made sure even first load figured would trust person instead finding use half thing detergent instead whole one one thing find mildly disturbing don know machine like hopefully someone email something let know read manual machine signal sound cycle finished expecting beep something like not heard heard music jingle bell no kidding thought one kid toy must machine something no fact washing machine playing tune jingle bell machine tune way change really not big fan song particularly since christmas come gone don really want listening jingle bell every time laundry anyone know anything please email wiccanwotton yahoo com thanks

pulsator not work though machine spin turn wash choice dial clockwise addition water keep coming tub mean choose one water level overflow besides bottom keep leaking reason never find please note first time used machine seems mailed broken one called haier america customer service admitted brand new washer broken pay postage return image

really like washer small space saving cheap great washer person living apartment washer great u installation problem pointed previous review want say not problem without husband help installation simple even not need read instruction install better read instruction first connect tap directly using sink adapter water hose need insert inlet jointer water hose already position receive maybe not need step connect hose connect hose washer small trick connection much easier connect sink adapter water hose tap first connect sink adapter water hose hose order may important since felt hard connect try connect sink adapter water hose tap last recommend cute item
using month although get machine work problem machine namely installation way difficult thought sink adapter fit water tap aerator living without kitchen forced spend lot time buying making converter order tap machine water source properly also think required height water exhaustion pipe way restrictive x lay bath tub many reviewer pointed machine requires baby sitting due balance load issue load filling half machine almost definitely cause machine stop one spin complete washing cycle consequently requires load rebalacing hand think machine better engineered get truly automatic user manual shall better written instruct user properly loading machine avoid problem possible said glad machine finally work useful work

purchased product month ago best buy sale little bit impulse buy got chance jumped online read review seriously concerned negative review site mainly concerning lack service authorized service center also seemed show pattern kegerator would not keep beer cold enough promised happy product reasonable amount time would post review balance thing personally don keep beer degree depending point cooling cycle kegerator beer usually degree plenty cold enough don need nipple beer mug happy cooling ability unit still concerned service issue may problem fortunately purchased year warranty offered best buy hopefully allow get replacement unit issue sale price able obtain unit think best bang buck unless make kegerator take half barrel
reason rated product company zero negative rating not available product proved defective le one month use contacting haier authorized service useless five five authorized service center haier provided service said would nothing company shared experience not documented forced troubleshoot problem refill co tank within one week determined problem defecitive keg tap attempt get haier send part useless call corporate office went unanswered successful service terrible never get back respond promised company far worst ever dealt customer service none terrible product terrible caution anyone not purchase product manufactured haier
reviewer stated dispenser freeze back not thaw nor temperature dispenser work correctly mine run warm even highest setting although customer service document call ottawa corporate office new york not return call three repair number customer service gave no good also told one repair person haier not reimburse repair result not come home customer service told twice recommended corporate office replace unit five six call placed past two month not received call progress action taken trying get dispenser serviced since september
beer dispenser week get work haier given name warranty center none work haier anymore don pay bill customer service center not giving answer either buck won work
first live denver co mile high city not enough beer line get decent pour changed tower could pour kind homebrew gal soda keg added couple foot beer line included line ft long pour decent keep mind live high elevation not pour right included equipment another problem temperature coldest setting degree beer need good pour reading review going calling requesting service call fix temperature issue decent unit money
agree two comment temperature product downside also seen back panel frost although mine normal setting aside keep keg cool beer fresh line freeze due line coming contact back panel long besides trooper guinness tap never tasted good
echo sentiment quality bought one similar problem won cool around degree despite manual clearly saying normal setting cool cooling plate back refrigerator frost normal setting colder not defrost either love cold tap beer house disappointed quality family bottle haier wine refrigerator work perfectly surprise mild disappointment plus unit attractive easy put together good value not piece together anything downside worked properly clamp co line clamp plastic clip cheap prone break penny haier could included regular metal hose clamp secure worked properly worth hose clamp would downside haven yet begun talking haier customer service next adventure steve mathesius yahoo com
would not recommend haier kegerator unless like warm beer set coldest setting let run day coldest got degree fahrenheit know nothing better warm beer really bad part wife ask wanted xmas said wanted danby kegerator came highly recommended good friend called beverage factory said danby problem getting cold enough get beer coldest optimal temperature highly recommended haier read line really saying get optimal profit selling haier also don recommend beverage factory never ask kind beer like drink different beer different type coupler send standard american coupler doesn work imported beer bad way around not mention probably lost keg bass beer god going upset don buy beverage factory try not buy china cr p buy something made u go wrong good luck everybody next round
college student favorite purchase time co might take little bit messing get right flow level don want flow fast cause way much foam dollar shipped door perfect energy efficient making old refridgerator would defiantly recommend one
bought gift someone ordered delivered promptly dispensing part missing since ordered contacted send remaining part mostly uncooperative day later missing part finally arrived haier warranty claim filed no idea haier received warranty claim contacted haier told bought refrigerator not beer dispenser dispensing part installed found compressor leak needed replaced waiting part far one month paid gift not used
searching lot different model kegerators finally settled unit although review not great best feature price temperature problem seems resolved get everything suppose come unit people complained missing washer secret kegerators allow hour refrigerator stabilize temperature putting keg one kegerators fit coors light barrel keg also c tank inside fridge model outside make unable push flush wall bad style coupler metal outside mostly plastic internal part don know hold long run restrainer c tank came mounting screw pilot hold small use screw not self tapping don plan moving kegerator around doubt c tank ever fall even without restrainer screw tower standard fillip head self tapping screw hard not strip screw mounting hex allen wrench style would better wheel come however no lock roll everywhere make hard use choose hope help considering kegerator bad minor overall feel great value
unit year gone keg fill co tank initial fill work great though drip try impossible empty without spilling fill luckily deal haier following adventure dealing customer service department date represents different day called haier order shipped order delivered not receive part including beer tap co regulator washer connecting co regulator co cylinder co cylinder keg tap american sankey type cleaning kit co gas line red tube called customer service told part missing faxed proof purchase told part would arrive day told order processed would arrive day told order processed not shipped would ship today called told order not yet processed expect shipment day processing told order would ship today got call saying part would arrive today tomorrow received package containing two washer hose clamp mind part missing include lb co tank package received small fit mail slot apartment called told received wrong part ordered new part told call back day told everything good call back day get tracking called told needed proof purchase faxed pop called back told call back next week get tracking called told order would ship received package missing part call day finally got part shipped originally ordered hope running birthday no dice hopefully never deal haier try patient patience isn thing recommend buying another manufacturer
unit six month quite happy play around bit get temperature pressure right set right though switch keg without go whole routine every time flushing line no better worse kegerators like unit serve great draft beer slightly lower cost per glass can bottle love not deal returnables two downside kegerator first vision rolling kegerator around house patio first time tried however frame member holding roller bent nearly snapped better put unit one spot leave second common kegerators better stong back keg dolly even keg extremely heavy
let start saying negative review product seem due missing c washer temperature regulation first go get co tank filled first time give washer don even really need include box place fill c tank give washer free second problem degree beer last time checked fridge kept beer degree fine year keg fridge keep beer degree not seen problem warm cannot beat price come item need except beer c planning get keg fridge please favor find sell c area buy keg easy find co harder come money definitely best value among keg fridge easy set caster make easy move around also converted mini fridge not keg instruction not great ok since set simple todd
entry level kegerator best evaporator unit limited back interior cabinet difficult maintain optimum beer temperature plus called automatic defrosting feature basically turning compressor unit warms point ice melt hardly automatic best performance invest couple hundred dollar unit evaporator panel three interior wall consistent temperature
research number conversation friend opted purchase product say awesome beer stay cold readily available probably available complaint fridge scuff mark appear result packaging process not shipping little assembly couple beer scuff mark weren much issue also quite impress quickly received product within day
work perfectly easy setup came accessory pound co container
many fun get togethers friend since purchasing item saved many trip store beer
owned product year returned beginning fridge stopped working completely today lost almost full keg temperature never cold enough always ice build back panel never defrosts lastly customer service department rude could care le researching keg fridge favor avoid haier beer dispenser brewmaster glad experience done haier product
work great haven problem keep keg steady degree careful setting don accidently throw small clear washer co connection people written not included likely threw hard see go atleast keg week no problem keg store exchange co tank paintball shop fill le way get keep nice new aluminum co tank
purchased unit iraq waiting got home no part missing set easy didn put caster bottom no plan moving unit far placed line hook well although first co bottle leaked failure check connection checked second one third full keg no problem cleaning line snap make sure check connection mess unit ice attribute fact left unit running without keg inside anyway good product
purchased brewmaster installation failed cool called customer serviced told technician would house service call technician came fixed problem two hour later broke called another service technician responded following day told bigger issue thought part needed ordered stated part would take least two week arrive called haier customer service told everything possible satisfied year warranty house repair taken two half day work late return retailer technician told hate haier product would never waste money junk lesson stay away haier product
don buy one worst customer service lie tell everything going fixed no response back even phone call month doesn keep beer cold enough electrical plug compressor shorted would not work got run around haier customer service sounded good don believe called new york coporate office got sorry warranty pay service tech dissatisfied quote best customer service advertise hope everone boycots haier product
overall far product go say quite happy beer dispenser no problem temperature adjustment not trying keep beer degree pours nicely component seem high quality aside plastic hose clamp co line easy replace metal one hardware store however agree reviewer haier customer service challenging wife bought dispenser christmas true love delivered neighbor house wouldn suspect anything december went retrieve box set basement upon opening unit discovered significant number part missing like entire co system tap keg connection basically mini fridge think someone shipping might notice box pound light whatever called haier fairly helpful first told fax list missing part along proof purchase told would couple day validate claim couple day process order two week part arrive called back every day see thing going easy get real person phone time people weren able offer much information apparently haier part warehouse located dark side moon impossible customer service tell part would shipping no way get tracking number no way know part stock nothing waited patiently three week part didn show called back surprise couldn tell happened talked supervisor haier told thing started resubmit order several part showing backordered screen no eta available point done haier called amazon explained situation said wanted get exchange refund first told contact manufacturer explained past month no luck agreed exchange no problem also said wasn one happened within two day replacement way tracking number thank amazon didn tap beer christmas new year birthday got super bowl good

stopped working day bought another target back gallon day bought last year worked
humidifier many year run many brand wick one sorry report didn last long would no longer wick come expect wick begin fail midway season pretty much toast end one month dry crusty touch
wick filter design flawed humidifiers supposed help alleviate symptom associated surrounding environment humidifying air help sensitive whats around lack thereof humidification go evaporative simple form probably best overall resembles occurs naturally unfortunately mechanism evaporative humidifiers designed wick material poor demonstrated filter ad humdifiers use wick disintegrate im sure owner touched seen black residue hand imagine residue blown air also turning humidifier filter tend get moldy give mildewy smell yes controlled chemical thats another topic discussion within day installing filter get mold mildew disintegrate particle air trying improve sake whatever condition wanting help

used holmes filter least dozen year work pretty well many range tap water soft hard water type available often reduces life filter especially heavy load mineral present tap water seems middle range use available water treatment product time add water bacteria inhibitor water treatment solution slows lime scale formation find get entire season single filter towards end season start flipping filter time add water also help keep filter soft absorbent without much crusty cling material forming water really loaded mineral may need use straight distilled water humidifier least cut tap water honestly no perfect filter medium humidifier using tap water work pretty well
guess suppose around week using began develop musty odor removed humidifier soaked bleach wash detergent solution remove smell also clean container hold water soap bleach solution remove bad odor
wick seem work well used always seem fine job
fit well easy replace going try washing dishwasher necessary suggested another customer review
no matter original box say no filter permanent forever couple year no longer able remove accumulated mineral permanent filter replacement make humidifier work like new never mineral dust spewed throughout room mentioned never use appliance highest fan setting always add distilled vinegar water would recommend replacement humidifier similar looking filter
used holmes humidifier year winter time put many filter time appreciate holmes make profit product much filter lasted le week confident water not changed since prior filter hope someone else making useful replacement cannot suggest buy product
purchased two able get approximately three week use two filter week two filter no longer wick water beyond bottom inch filter tremendous waste money

product limited wicking property day installation evaporation water substantially reduced
fit holmes humidifier fine seem good life better filter used bought primarily relatively low price time impressed quality surrounding mesh seems plastic rather flimsy aluminum mesh hold better rejuvenate vinegar soak filter aluminum mesh tend fall apart
last longer fit better doesn dry third party product last week high use since not absorbent don fit correctly great filter
used filter year quite satisifed purchase amazon although come find ou ti several extra box therefore not needing
work week top filter not wick water not rotate filter daily operation original filter came machine worked season long replaced disappointed filter website filter pictured sell not one also plan trying directly holmes next filter purchase
something wrong holmes humidifier wick past ive able get winter three wick using hard water wick simply got full mineral stopped working not problem last two wick ordered amazon lasted couple day stopped wicking one week top get not cheap think shall write holmes complain holmes forget make wick intolerable

tell temp humidity wish temp would go humidity phoenix
somewhat accurate displaying temperature humidity test humidity temperature put another one outside backyard went online check humidity weather area machine accurate faster matching weather service hour vicks temp humidity although put room hour difference monitor strange good enough guess
work one received accurate nearest even degree temp ie show never odd amount humidity seems report accurately
refinishing basement wanted know relative humidity started framing isn truly sophisticated unit gave enough information keeping daughter room watch humidity level reduce incidence nose bleeds good unit price
worked well day went blank changed battery still nothing returned amazon full credit yay amazon

like compact easy read screen use wood working shop keep eye humidity bought unit one one elderly mother complaint mother unhappy show humidity humidifier broke happy show humidifier running full blast
purchased item recently moving tropical climate arid one experiencing major sinus issue previously purchased venta room humidifier no idea actual humidity level unit appears fairly accurate thermometer right price probably purchased several
monitor broke couple month tried replacing battery multiple time still not work incredibly disappointed regret purchase not buy waste money broke day return window expired
wish would light could see temperature humidity night always go kid room phone flash light see say would also great would light corresponding humidity color shown display also really hard see night
nice little gadget don know accuracy humidity found showing different humidity level different one house yes compared next hour even case don know give clue humidity level
refresh time could little quicker price reasonable know not going get fast precise humidity reading like advanced psychometric would give overall not bad don humidity sensor cross reference see recording accurately assuming
unit fit bill simple inexpensive humidity temperature model bought two late one stopped working last month still functioning far disappointed failure rate would recommend looking option choosing monitor ordered another brand bit le expensive also track indoor humidity temperature high low reading
using six week seems work well right humidity ok ukulele since laminate lol update bought second one put room day one read humidity degree read humidity degree don fooled way accurate update bought third one read others say best within actually humidity level best guess like not going give one star rating see good get price range brand oh also got three different temp rating don use product accuracy critical update figured third one not drop humidity no matter relative humidity today registered outside porch junk way vicks doesn make company make not warranty defect called wouldn trust review friend folk not really checked product opinion hate keep harping another tasty tidbit info customer support person laid asked much variance casually informed whole production run three came might bad mean course no quality control check come line ship em without ever testing even occasional one lol problem people buy one get reading assume good go come slap five star rating
bought daughter room work great check every night make feel comfortable room temp okay also humidity room right sick great see well humidifier working recommend
bought track relative humidity house winter combat dry skin happy cheap accurate tool feature fit intended use fine
first bought primarily thermometer function make sure newborn nursery comfortable temperature liked small compact didn think would really utilize humidity reading wrong love reading one compact monitor air dry know turn son humidifier keep comfortable night long complaint wish option turn back light could see reading dark needed
bought thermometer humidity monitor help calm nerve give better night sleep unbearably cold polar vortex january chicago frantic keep month old warm pack n play bedroom unfortunately location crib near cold window constantly worrying cold room got check several time night finally broke purchased vicks health check monitor built thermometer work great humidity monitor added bonus basic unit reasonable price gave star could really use clock backlight feature nighttime monitoring additionally little wobbly tip easily
monitor good checking temp daughter room not confirm temp don trust baby monitor also let u know humid dry room allergy helpful especially winter heat constantly running
pretty handy around house particularly winter dry indoors nasal passage get dry cracked plus help allergy aka cold downside no backlight led light feature read dark room gave star
well made need light view baby sleeping function work well feel like high quality product
july update review put unit storage box moving arizona decided compare two monitor newly installed thermostat indoor outdoor thermometer surprise temperature humidity reading monitor pretty close satisfied review purchased monitor expected degree accuracy especially regarding humidity feature temperature feature pretty accurate however humidity feature not acceptable comparision humidifer wall display vicks monitor would not recommend purchasing monitor
humidity reading seems accurate least assume reading update fairly quickly move monitor room room not totally sure accuracy thermometer temperature reading generally close reading house thermometer however tried testing monitor taking outside reading barely changed according phone degree outside even staying outside minute monitor reading went low degree returned original monitor purchased thing figured defective replacement monitor thing either temperature reading not accurate reading take really long time update
temperature seems accurate corresponds thermostat room humidity responsive could breath see change keep baby crib adjust heat humidifier accordingly actual accuracy relative humidity irrelevant know reading monitor give baby seems comfortable exactly needed
not compared another hygrometer seems going reasonable amount line outside humidity level reported weather website see number rising humidifier used temperature reporting accurate match number displayed ac
one room suspect accuracy even put new battery put room next totally different reading one said humidity said humidity won relying anymore don recommend anyone
product not seem accurate take long time change not looking needed accurate temp
humidity percentage dominate room temperature available simultaneously background bought check humidifier ala returned developing loud rattle not conducive sleep like others able read dark would nice need leave small flashlight nearby purpose go easily room room stand well
item say dominant display humidity reading temperature relegated small display upper right corner somewhat disappointed temperature referenced daily hourly basis product accurately described website mistake not looking carefully still keep product
however take time update use general indicator humidity definitively not precise
thing accurate tell temp humidity level room home really appreciate scale bottom telling want humidity level thing would like would lit little almost impossible read dimly lit room baby room always look middle night go feed see dark don want turn light work expected
product easy use clear number printed front year use screen went blank assumed battery turned dead tried several battery no avail worked great not impressed limited lifespan
purchased unit checked unit known accurate one perfect one deg better not bad
purchased monitor would know relative humidity temperature around orchid doubt accuracy placed two thermometer around reading vicks monitor degree lower thermometer couple degree percent humidity aren important reason giving star instead addition humidity temp change quickly move one location another considered plus would definitely purchase unit

little odd smell add water humidifier going minute smell everyone else household cannot smell freaky sensitive smeller smell house super power use cc syringe put solution humidifier almost perfectly capful recommended per instruction still air humidifier every day let dry completely no problem algae bacteria looking sludge think work great slight smell
product exactly designed stop bacteria mold growth reservoir need next winter
guess say make sure add fill humidifier otherwise soapsuds
rather difficult measure pour product seems work okay

assume helping make filter last longer see
allowed use one filter wick holmes humidifier winter recommend anyone note not use hot humidifiers eat metal

city water chlorination don really notice effect mold odorless clear
work well keeping filter developing mold filter would eventually get pink mold growing couple week no longer happens even month thing could make product better came measured way dispensing right amount risking getting hand yes know wear glove would nice didn
good product
use generic brand bacteriostat sears humidifier worked fine no issue whatever illness no discernible mold mildew build good value well see no drawback product
work advertised arrived time
came without cap make hard store properl
early tell whether effective
hard really know stuff working not using week evaporative humidifier go throught gallon water day tank remain sparkly clean don see buildup filter case suppose no evidence good recommend adding product tank full not added cause lot bubble foam overflow
purchased product essick air humidifier made mistake using without fully reading direction basically read quickly required cap full gallon water get skin washed impossible fill cap full pour cap water bottle without spilling hand immediately splashed hand rinsed hand bathtub faucet filling rest bottle later realized thumb turned white damaged dry skin spending time direction read chemical caustic cause irreversible eye damage used google face shield glove already caught cat drinking water reservoir humidifier filling bottle fortunately added chemical see keep drinking next time fill humidifier bottle adding chemical water risk chemical splashing seems high not buy goggles keep humidifier mold free unfortunately going search safer product cat
terrible time getting product product appears water say supposed something no smell change used large humidifier
wasn really happy active ingredient stuff could never tell emitted air tested ph strip found pretty neutral would appear warning not burn moreso chemical exposure made nervous tried alternative found effective three wick hand rotate night quick soap rinse humidifier way wick fully dry rotated use humidifier run hour day winter no stench algae growth buildup alternate chemical free method
poisonous
careful not use ultrasonic humidifiers mine broke
got throw label make product sound hazardous don even want think breathing well used brand new filter next day filter already started changing brown color got better alternative
not impressed foamed not seem lengthen duration clean water humidifier not sure good breathing long period tried switching sliver cartridge instead seem natural act better
fact cannot used ultrasonic humidifiers description put cap bold print since type humidifier gained large market share frequently used noted prominently
appropriate cleaner sears vaporizing humidifiers
far good humidifier filter definitely not building algae not smell complaint seems little soapy bubble add water tank even little water left no smell though humidifier probably save u money course season

using le instruction warning label make stuff sound toxic don get skin wash skin immediately don ingest keep away child don get eye etc stuff vaporized air no telling might effect family pet assume safe since actually legal sell mentioned lowered amount use safe might not buy fear promise extends life filter
run humidifier quite often glad mean keep bacteria growing spreading blow moist air room
cut algae calcium build smell fresh wish cheaper seems last pretty long
bestair okay exactly half volume exact main ingredient bacteriostat holmes also sold amazon don understand bestair get many rave review holmes product need use twice much bestair don work holmes promise

small easily changed filter good job humidifying fresh air not always readily available n local store
good product used non ultrasonic humidifiers designed fine nothing tell work
used product year always cap suggested fill line cap disappointment
isn original oz strength half original got oz
added two capful new humidified time filled reservoir say noticed difference still white crust like buildup humidifier clean daily don know worked not

purchased along bestair l c filter lasko humidifier fill water container set tub ease use water treatment drilled small hole cap invert bottle squeeze bit container time use water going bottom fill filter water container piece cake
product worked like said would someone problem would recommend product
work well seems good brand bought locally year would recommend good product
far good using bacteriostat solution haven noticed bad odor coming humidifier solution low chemical odor kinda smell like rug doctor carpet cleaning solution
really not much say product work contrary product read label may cross finger hope product work product work say going
unable pinpoint wether thing not not last long used directed may good not sure cannot figure way determine
used product whole house humidifier able raise humidity acceptable level master bedroom digress disliking trudge store brick motar storefront searching stock product resorted search engine thing purchase amazon com think product say no real way assessing no legionaires disease plague befallen u good go far crossed finger complaint recent bottle accurately pictured offer flat attached cap direction use printed well bacterium could read without use magnifying glass clearly advised getting product person especially eye clothing pouring cap full per certain gallon water wha huh clearly impossible new delivery system mindful danger involved according instruction carefully decanted anti bacterial agent former container real bottle cap measure unnecessary risk consumer slipshod production manufacturer doesn anybody end read instruction use detail people detail unacceptable
purchased product original no opinion yet regarding quality far seems ok
used product older humidifier continues provide water protection needed continue order
seems work fine no mildewy smell humidifier time tell probably good product since summer way humidifier doesn odor come winter done job
good water treatment must humidifiers fill bill however shipping department wasn awake day sent bottle no cap bottle thing holding product safety seal luckily product not travel air
using product week first started humidifier season still little bacteria odor even cleaning added product day almost no detectable bacteria odor would give product star except haven using long enough sure may problem foaming causing problem humidifier try remember update review update foam much humidifier cause annoying snapping sound humidifier like bubble bursting except louder sharper nothing terrible run humidifier low stop making annoying noise run high anymore sound like mild electrical arching wonder foam getting electrical control top unit
say bacteria fighting agent supposed no complaint humidifier work fine
bought use brand new honeywell quietcare humidifier using rated strength one lid full solution per gallon water unpleasantly surprised discover new humidifier evaporation chamber orange organic muck within first day continual use admittedly hard water prepared see white crust scale least filter kind organic growth understand water treatment supposed inhibit prevent trial error discovered requires twice manufacturer suggested rate solution keep water clean suspect go full bottle month use not sure worthwhile compared simply cleaning tank rinsing filter periodically echo review comment refilling partially drained tank get lot foaming add bt treatment water rather filling tank nearly brim topping capful two solution although fair foam subsides quickly within minute accidentally reverse order balance not sure treatment cost effective add evaporative humidifiers
not much say solution counter growth bacteria humidifier water supposed huzzah
large whole house humidifier filter standing water tend grow pinkish bacteria day not kept check permanently discolor filter imagine bacterial colony humidifier healthy found solution don need much label directs supposed approximately capful per gallon water get away roughly half long added every change water bacteria seems kept bay one large humidifiers cylindrical filter also suggest flipping filter twice daily typically add water bacteria seem like slightly drier top part filter keep end bit damper give exposure antibacterial agent water couple side effect however one filter somewhat slippery slimy white film not really problematic except flip filter get gunk hand sort bleachy smell another thing note adding chemical cause water foam fill tank suggest filling tank first adding chemical otherwise likely end foam flowing tank getting everywhere get faucet washing whatever come next antibacterial agent might not ideal
product cost le alternative effectively controlc bacteria mold humidifier water reservoir buy product
could purchased lot le would not pay shipping tried ok would not buy
purchased father law using product year no problem ease use product say pleased product
even use le suggested keep filter cleaner longer product found measuring one capfull hard emptied content tight sealing wide mouth container cottage cheese container use small syringe no needle easily insert equivalent dose humidifier tank not concern chemical injestion others
found lower rating product terrifying didn notice already placed order probably would not ordered seen earlier however used product without rubber glove would describe mildly acidic not terribly concentrated harsh chemical harsher regular household cleaner said would want chemical water treatment two word legionnaire disease legionellosis thing worse chemical house household humidifier especially larger one please careful prevent bacterial growth
don know deal stuff made filter go bad much faster using regular tap water used vornado humidifier would not buy also product came mail not packed well leaked box
wasn aware product dangerous skin wear glove harm skin several warning danger back don believe something go air humidifier therefore air home harmful sure healthy lunge used one time won use also don want worried get contact skin water spill don notice someone step would want family friend child even pet get contact poisonous solution without knowing
using stuff couple week along new evaporative room humidifier seems quite effective keeping bacteria building humidifier reason give product four star rather five given rather scary warning bottle concerned breathing stuff also always petrified go refill tank cat going try drink humidifier base thinking chemical corrosive contact permanently damage skin warning suggests cannot great lung neither mold find better product using stuff every third fill
searched find bacteriostatic product purify water evaporative humidifier popular found getting realized bottle covered warning chemical harsh even touch skin need flush skin water minute call poison control center read online people permanent chemical burn product say right product cause permanent damage started thinking oh god going vaporized family breathes make matter worse tried use advises use cap per gallon water close impossible pour without spilling everywhere wore thin plastic glove best control safety ran side bottle splashed narrow cap mess clean otherwise toxic chemical around fortunately wife cousin told organic alternative grapefruit seed extract using nbsp data hook product link linked class link normal href nutribiotic gse liquid concentrate fl oz liquid dp b oops ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf nutribiotic gse liquid concentrate fl oz liquid nbsp swears read review online look great not toxic many us going give try put review mean time bottle toxicity going trash
haven really seen evidence using product actually anything filter still get mildewy water left sitting day two suspect bleach would actually work better much cheaper option
reading ingredient not sure wanted sprayed air breathe never used
unfortunately add shipping cost product purchase item expensive go local walmart comparable product save shipping cost
unfortunately haven chance use sure work great since living proof received package wrapped double plastic foil three wrapped another plastic unfortunately leaked lost fluid first instinct rinse water wash hand minute hand begin burn bad read back say not responsible anything handle glove wash water skin contact minute kind warning etc wish big red label warning box know dealing toxic dangerous product open late needle say demand full refund report immediately still convinced work well absolutely careless packaging shipping advance warning handle amazon doesn give warning early either careful product
product supposed reduce prevent growth mold bacteria etc humidifier seems effectively however add reservoir first add water mix fully foam badly way prevent excessive foaming add product last cap reservoir shake mix
quite humidifier air cleaner product much better job bacteria control product used manufacturer recommended use humidifiers others well humidifier getting blade proper job air cleaning humidifier part water get putrid quite quickly environment help manage controlling nasties getting air humidifier process
problem vornado humidifier wick water growing orange algae becoming quite stale brown high humidity day winter replacing filter number time winter cleaning humidifier pan great solving problem use recommended amount previously using drop two bleach try keep water clean not effective

thing beautiful last couple year replacing builder grade white appliance stainless debated whether go stove microwave range hood finally opted range hood eventually landed one look great way constructed shown alot steel front great make whole stove area look modern really frame thing focal point kitchen couple word warning first love look halogen bulb order amazon replace one already local sears store asking one halogen bulb next word warning buy pair work glove sheet metal shred hand not careful u non ducted installation breeze would not shoddy construction practice builder ducted installation seemed bit involved u really mostly matter removing part didnt need wiring fed old range hood worked great reused old strain relief grommet something dad would frowned upon reused old wire nut connecting white white black black wire nut attaching bare ground wire screw physically mounting hood proved challenging part u hole provided mounting didn line anything screw fussing finally gave decided right way couple scrap x screwed underside cabinetry gave plenty mounting surface easy finally embarrassingly putting last hopefully no one read remove knob stove tell many time accidentally turned gas leaning knob finally heartbreakingly mounting new hood lay piece cardboard something stove tell instruction thought protect stove turn stove grate scratch stainless steel pretty well although hood still look great going see scratch left
would fine range hood money almost impossible install couldn life figure modify baffle round vent eventually gave used piece black duct tape instead not ideal least work simple install turned circus also noticed really quiet lowest setting sure setting nothing much get vented hand higher setting though much louder pull plenty air planning professional install unit ended go otherwise find another range hood
look modern kitchen sort old fashioned not good match style wise worse something cooking stove sending smoke fan turned doesn really seem draw well wouldn buy
look great light great fan low really quiet doesn move much air fan high noisy job halogen provides light level low equal old incandescent hood high awesome star not including filter
low speed quite high speed vibrates little noisy visually see fan blade not aligned wobble maybe got defective one checked installed would tried get exchange
general like finish installation pro good looking don look inside cost effective con build quality horrible see gap front view vent rectangle top almost impossible get rectangle piece keep top surface flat end gap vent hose cost another dollar buy bulb
hood easy install actually intalled hood vent side since gas range fit perfectly place old broan hood wasn vented outside new hood relatively quiet fan need purchase light bulb instruction fairly easy follow see could better filter came product look rather cheap seen filter ge model seem better quality however would still recommend item good buy
main problem stove front burner lighting not outside venting smoke billow around light instead vent hood overall like look great don problem bulb glaring cook
make kitching look good easy use trouble installing due cabinet shape set easy use give star cover light bulb
good looking good feature sadly hired handyman highly rated yelp idiot general trained monkey dirty black paw didn make happier small dent front unit monkey boy installed anyway destroyed box inspection dented no idea install terrible two reason unrelated product get reinstalled somebody brain hood sleek modern feature packed winner unpack inspect allowing monkey install kicking
like stainless finish ability put filter charcoal filter not impressed design reference setup vent outside doesn recirculate boiling water example find steam either go away not thru vent go thru recess light thereby completely bypassing filter think designer considered might keep brief replacing something better
work great loud high setting silent low setting slight assembly required light bulb recommended extremely bright high setting
like little scratch stainless received would nice come protective film removed installation match new s stove refrigator well good price
sharp edge careful installing cover sharp edge tape lighting good gathering emission front burner limited due positon exhaust vent intake price major factor decision buy
main problem stove front burner lighting not outside venting smoke billow around light instead vent hood overall like look great don problem bulb glaring cook
purchased range hood offgrid house fan lower consumes le thirty watt power quite silent integrated par light nice touch coupled led bulb give enough light cook night plain look cool light switch low setting doesn seem work lot led bulb
unit arrived well packaged protected way alaska unit not ship bulb wiring charcoal filter intend non vented installation fan housing crooked plastic fan wobble struck one side little dead blow hammering pry bar able straighten defect fan motor mount clearly shorter one side appears manufacturing defect v shipping no external damage noted unpacking heart beast not might rated star purchase additional filter bulb make work little unreasonable given premium price unit air flow excellent fairly quiet step away good looking hood
ceiling fan went attic year thought vent attic connected wasn husband decided first upgrade kitchen took new hood straight roof attachment not expensive add spent hour making sure done right home old year still cloth wiring got licensed electrician see work minute love
unit ok overhead light switch burnt day installation not apply warranty won buy broan canadian address
definitely step previous broan hood much quieter better filtration system better lighting installed easily required little modification receiving space due larger size new hood location mounting hole not significant problem even slightly handy hood extends farther previous unit look good get used larger overhang aware ship set aluminum filter charcoal filter bulb must ordered separately charcoal filter recommended install easily clip provided
item replaced year old hood part kitchen update use ductless mode meant purchase pair filter augment mesh aluminum filter since replaced another model manufacturer install template job done le minute pro stylish quiet low speed halogen light purchased separately make well lit work area con fan high speed not quiet move air
item look ok product construction quality not good couple spot weld would made item much better
product fit pretty well space needed got excellent price amazon taking away one star not quiet marketed look great kitchen probably would buy
hood fan great buy box store definitely expensive issue light probably need order one suggested fan
nice fit finish especially like flush look underside fan quiet low not bad high mfg say halogen incandescent bulb work used watt led bulb super efficient like look need dimmable want use low high lighting setting
look great work well even though house old look good kitchen would fit modern style home easily low setting extremely quiet medium setting would nice extra high setting much quieter old range hood somewhat noisy time medium might better choice still happy hood lack mid range setting not make break issue light nice bright turned le light wanted also like large filter area make efficient venting
purchased replace range microwave arrived direction easy understand assembly fairly simple built light easy mount may need second person assist though hard hold one hand screw also please note hood not come ready plug outlet need splice home electrical wiring could run local home center purchase wiring kit make plug plug outlet would given star not also sharp edge underside sliced little bit tried screwing place ouch careful
good nice looking hood noisy high speed also don forget buy filter don connect ducting
looking around couple store best price found item wanted
get smoke grease plenty end rest kitchen not really quiet either price range pretty much limited nutone don know lousy option
good value well made range hood using non vented plenty draft super quiet s finish top notch
love fan except one thing ridiculous ritual changing light bulb already gone month would think day age would difficult change light bulb want become kind joke many homeowner take change broan light bulb first need make sure not throw away little rubber suction cup look like leftover part something get fight light bulb not want come right won war one fighting second decided write review hopefully win wwii engage husband first light bulb decided take two broan u great overhead light fan bulb went might mention old loud fan think changed bulb twice year
hood look performs well difficult install would not recommend contractor put
broan range hood add modern update kitchen fan not loud function well love halogen light bright would recommend product price
earlier version since late installed one round ducting new home previous installation similar fan used x ducting not sure due poor ducting installation x ducting not efficient one seems move much greater volume air quiet quieter previous model
range hood look nice make little noise like vent run give nice lighting
nice hood think manufacturer put emphasis look functionality first think noticed isn really quite not least way description indicated second think boil water front burner range need turn fan full wise condensation accumulate around light drip onto stove top overall full speed nice job pulling air away cooking surface dual lighting system really nice hood attractive look nice kitchen buy another think would still purchase one work well high speed sound isn issue like styling
purchased replace product manufacturer owned twenty five year exactly expected no reason expect one won perform well
several thing wrong range hood doesn seem draw lot air two filter bottom seem large close hood circular fan portion surface air flowing overhanging part hood also nothing trap smoke steam hot air draw toward filter boil big pot spaghetti front burner steam roll front hood room worse grease get trapped filter inside hood filter collect quickly start drip filter back onto stove happens week cooking despite fact little frying another minor point bother hood doesn use standard light bulb instead pocket behind diffuser top bulb project downward front hood use short bulb flattened top would rather option using standard round bulb would never want put compact florescent bulb hood even short one would looking directly bulb coil
nice new shiny stainless steel body look good replaced original broan model year old hope last long metal thinner old one doesn mean won last long sound level miss variable speed old one new one speed
unit arrived great shape time install snap fan quiet low speed noisy previous econo fan high speed light bulb not included expensive good enough think prefer older design
ordered particular hood reading quiet not really no quieter cheap builder hood replaced lot expensive also far larger expected stick room previous hood positive side draw air well two light not one making easier see work surface
construction bit flimsy especially comparison year old vent replaced place guess doesn matter whole lot hopefully switch motor stand well use fan high setting quite loud also need halogen lamp specific size seems bit bogus could easily put standard lamp holder imho
delivery promised overall finish good unit decently quiet design issue unit shape location light not shielded direct line vision bulb light stove top good bonehead designer think staring halogen bulb stylish need schooling reality glare obnoxious even height imagine upset shorter person would build glare shield stainless steel remedy oversight part designer people capability modification build quality issue installation rivet back holding leaf spring retain filter rivet improperly installed protruding back unit prevented mounting flush wall place crud accumulate aren thing leave unaddressed new kitchen drilled offending rivet installed new enabling tight fit wall easy seam seal
shopped lowes homedepot listed best price easy install work great
bought range hood much research liked vented microwave x ventilation score many people thought vented great already microwave love ended spending hood charcoal filter light would enclusive microwave cost installed professionally needed something everytime cook nowhere fume vent whole house smell like food night also frying food put grease air coating wall cupboard item film oil attracks dust lived house year finally couldn take anymore spent nearly year house outside venting hood stove first house downsize owned old kitchen isn vented imagine consternation finally spent several hundred don old person fixed income house still smell food yes charcoal filter installed correctly fan barely exhaust high setting spent don yet another product doesn suppose yes noise level low barely discernable barely running certaining not exhausting anything stove directly
beautiful lighting exceptional finish flimsy light weight thin metal not hold straight line top unless mounted extra screw not provided lot interior sharp edge cut hand motor quiet even top setting not effectively draw front element burner slow speed fan mounted close rear effective speed need thoughtful design realistic setting like kitchen
shell beautiful installed kitchen still hollow soup construction quality cheap sounding switch gear flimsy sounding fan material cheaper model resculpted course slightly quieter motor hoped would bit substantial least sound non vent filter don even snap tiny fin keep place aluminum one work guess matter end
looking something functional inexpensive got paid previous fan not duct exterior make essentially useless main objective correct buying range hood would not purchase one designed either ducted non ducted use little plastic piece cover opening top hood ducting outside not particularly effective result air end recirculating right back kitchen not great guess could put tape opening want next time least get model designed exterior ducting hood look nice enough still function form hence star
would given product star except skeptical whether received new new returned product purchased stainless steel product past new product experience always come blue transparent protector layer product not product also not include screw anything extra part opened box literally range hood filter think pay extra filter cannot positive since back luckily original range hood also broan product line able reuse screw bulb
sturdy range hood stainless steeel go appliance nice looking problem filter came bent ordered second set came damaged also third set ordered ok
range hood good purchase price look modern stainless steel really love updated kitchen hood quiet low mode little loud high not disruptive little loud overall great buy
install went alright except needed longer bolt one provided due lip cabinet installed finished kitchen nicely money unit look sound sharp going use hood ductless option don forget buy charcoal filter set light bulb also not included
hood great especially like fact lit bulb not included able find local home depot fan not noticeable low setting although hear bit louder high setting suction great well also come option duct either top back hood hole outlined back top choose way want duct pop
easy install look great hood little higher standard still look great high speed fan little loud move air complaint light give lot heat since halogen would buy hood
much research settled broan q met expectation find low speed fan adequate cooking extremely quiet however high speed little louder would like
hood look good quality control lacking arrived without part bag entailed trip home depot extra part installation fan also make ting ting ting sound low ting ting ting sound high motor quiet care try find blade hitting not
amazed quickly hood arrived first especially right christmas good looking fan slow speed nearly silent faster speed louder naturally husband installed minimal fuss working super ever since like two setting light would buy no problem would given star nothing perfect
rangehood work well not hard install greasy inside probably not cleaned well prior ship no information provided manual etc able figure
bought lowe installed ordered second one saw much cheaper amazon selling compared lowe second one arrived took lowe got refund unit look good really like recessed lighting fan quiet low setting fact noise room hear fan low disappointment cord meant hard wired outlet instead plugged great
love double light actually light entire stovetop low speed super quiet high speed make noise not like old range hood
great looking hood however amazon not specify cabinet mount hood meaning need cabinetry stove order install hood underneath forced return hood therefore cannot review operation look look great amazon gave full refund amazon awesome
low fan basically venting excess heat not pull much high speed job opening hole matched old hood made installation easy hood lightweight also help make installation much easier great appearance modern looking
range hood definately different look one husband confused whether like dislike love hood brings light bit higher traditional hood two fan setting low high light setting along two light used halogen flood light high setting really light entire range surrounding counter space unlike traditional hood clean finished look underneath
purchased product wanted match stainless steel appliance notice hood larger era hood inherited previous owner home time update installation not hard diy type person purchased hood chain home improvement store didn look review amazon like normally see others view quality product shocked learn amazon sell hood purchased le purchased store wow big difference cheapness weren weighed laziness take hood back refund purchase amazon oh well lesson learned
attractive unit high speed fan setting provides good stove top venting not useable extreme noise level however light nice
using hood couple year would like comment functionality get daily use cooking variety food pro still look good seems holding well get compliment quiet low setting fine steamed vegetable anything doesn make smoke quiet forget running actually cooking however need second setting quite bit louder love halogen light price good get con biggest drawback doesn remove smoke grease adequately pan seared item cooked front burner kick smoke alarm regular basis finished deep cleaning living room greasy dust top curtain rod ft away kitchen reason would not recommend fan open floor plan small issue frequent bulb burnout exhaust go thru light since fan portion span back two burner grease collect corner unit drip onto counter unless wiped frequently
much liked range hood bigger previous hood plus see pot range lighting great fan little noisy high fine low happy purchase price great deal

noisy
flimsy material build
spot welding not done properly not joined place especially front corner noticed installing hood case late inspect hood properly spot welding preparing installation unit made fit different configurable vent option implemented bad flimsy way prepared seal vent not used safe mean installing hood otherwise air leak defeat purpose hood would known purchase would opted get another hood one vent option interested unlike universal configurable vent fan rumble time run quietly reviewer mentioned keep low slowly increase fan speed avoid rumbling positive product look look great

fan loud
unit month reviewer suggested fan making loud rattling noise sound like fan little balance problem semi alieviated highest setting still really loud bought one claimed quieter guess could spent le gotten quality dramatically improve air quality kitchen apartment anyone else able fix issue news installation breeze found video u tube drill ran power need people shouldn take hour used non ducted option bought additional charcoal filter plug didn hard wire anything
range hood installed yesterday replaced previous cheaper broan range hood purchased year ago new range hood much quieter previous hood seems filter little better positioned previous broan really like quiet fan compared cheaper broan absolutely quiet high no course not not deafening high either hood look really nice footprint previous broan since side range hood exposed hood attached cupboard rather sandwiched cupbards happy see side also stainless steel thought photo looked side not stainless far good happy hood no problem switch previous reviewer mentioned also put two led light light not burn ugly hole light cover happened previous light cover using old incand bulb however dual light switch not work led one setting light don mind update hood age appears make noise point rarely use vibrates unable fix problem seems vibration coming motor area fan motor seem make noise first purchased must admit rarely use noise vibration
not sure air flow coming front black templet place still draft also hood doesn capture steam smoke half go right front face took filter see problem seems outlet outside open ok working product look nice light bright fan noise reasonable maybe not installed properly contractor said not happy
arrived time went easy problem motor bracket not set right fan would rub filter use take back adjust motor bracket pain as bracket welded
first took box happy look installing ventless adapter round rectangle vent got old vent started looking way mounted not happy mounting hole new hood inside inch old one might not big deal nothing mount unless screwed cupboard bottom screw sticking inside cupboard cupboard year old old hood screwed bottom outside edge cupboard screw stay wood drill new hole inch edge vent pre drill new hole bottom cupboard measured time make sure would line get help holding put new screw don large hole guide screw head slot hole rear power wire also inch higher old vent dug plaster allow wire raise higher meet hole old vent stronger made seam little flimsy cheaply made fan good not loud high position switch nice range high low high low light switch work well seam cheaply made thing tell turn almost feel like might break note make sure get watt bulb smaller fit cover nice looking hood vent work well feel money could built little better really don understand make every thing uniform word make mounting hole wire hole place don modify thing take box mount
installed unit put rated bulb light hr use night light dead fish smell started fill house traced range hood worked metal stamping plant recognized order machining lube used forming metal impregnated stainless not clean not pleased poor quality return installed
excited get ventilation system kitchen replaced one simply recycled air whereas one vent outside upon installation one two light worked called customer service pleasant experience spent well minute trouble shooting finally decided send new lighting part one switch faulty everything worked great three month fan started get really noisy turned high almost balance cleaned blade best could no improvement light bulb melted plastic cover dropped bit ended touching plastic later insert new plastic cover made modification light assembly hold way plastic cover heat light bulb still making crack right light come feel like coming checked wiring strong connection made sure bulb screwed tightly cannot honesty recommend product ever look great work lousy buyer beware

unit arrived good order quickly wished better model looked good better mean light switch doesn work properly need get new switch groan initially turn unit go high setting low setting need start low slowly bring desired speed high might take couple minurs settle might take couple adjustmens unit find groove light switch find spot settle low setting cook without irritation also smaller rear unit front don find much problem also take little black grill front although small plastic solid shield still leaked lot front vented installation used black gorilla tape hole replaced grill trimmed tape light fixture doesn accomodate bulb bigger w bulb although found led bulb fit use total watt rather watt suggested thought broan used engineer design thing bulb light together instead going one bulb two bulb
personally would gone different range reason picked one due size contraints look kind cheap metal thin flimsy even dual damper cold air still rush unit arrived piece loose box broke due jostled around sheet metal used fabricate wasn completely tight unit metal flap back forth making alot noise think louder don feel like dealing sending back getting another one issue repeat jerry rigged fix issue disappointed would get zephyr
got range hood branded kenmore look exactly pro variable speed fan not low high speed good look strong enough move air high con really annoying buzz motor tranformer speed expensive model didn fit motor perfectly quiet low although high low speed high speed sounded like jet engine noise bummer good

light stopped working month no way tell problem would anymore
not happy amazon show complete assembly offering part several time wanted complete assembly picture showed complete assembly received part no text describe product either result several return getting correct item
product supposed however need replacing recomendation price cheapest anywhere
still got white dust even using using distilled water bought simple hot water vaporizer
not worth price want accurately measure rh way compared cheaper monitor won purchase wouldn recommend
capacitive sensor within arrived unfortunately isn really possible calibrate one control must setting offset slope nonadjustable properly calibrateable
although humidity meter say calibrate company not offer calibration kit rh cal calibration kit not work humidity meter model called company meter calibrate rh cal calibration kit model misleading even extech company not advertise calibratable don make compatible calibration kit return buy model order ability calibrate
extech hygrometer not accurate ran meter standard salt humidity test used tested along hygrometer hand salt test creates stable known humidity sealed container accurate hygrometer read rh extech reached surprised repeated test trying find error test methodology time read unit read low low reading not problem multi turn pot allows user trim rh adjustment even includes clear instruction procedure proved impossible trim pot already adjusted upper limit turning trim pot not affect relative humidity reading another reviewer wrote soft click sound rh trim pot reach upper limit trim pot work direction could decrease rh value not helpful said like product extech amazing extech multimeter bench next right hygrometer extech instrument always proven high quality good value reviewer report good result meter must received dud test meter use
waste time money original replacement unit come uncalibrated didn understand know cannot calibrate humidity bogus screw nothing however easily adjust temperature luckily several dependable unit compare company advises using calibration kit kind pointless adjusting screw nothing disappointing returning replacement unit well avoid brand future
far no complains
pro accurate reading detachable probe con short wire ten inch good enough put probe window display right side window not convenient want reading remote distance
device came already not functioning display wouldn turn no visible damage word caution even decide try luck advised device feel flimsy cheap would never think cost
specification indicate unit measure unit received never go rh environment meter electronics assembly glovebox measured expensive professional dewpoint meter left glovebox hour still reading rh calibration no measurable effect unit total absolute garbage avoid entirely sending back spec purchased reviewing save many people unit
temperature seems little bit okay use
nothing bad product far
bought two unit show two difference measurement humidity temperature inaccurate don even bother
don expect thing last forever especially one made china think year little short gauge never good measuring humidity much screw suppose adjust like many customer stated nothing get instrument work better price
battery didn last long installing new batter worked another month completely dead month accurate not worth
always thought reading seemed device expert right anyway wanted second moisture meter wouldn need keep taking one back forth bedroom living room ordered le expensive acurite amazon versus inadvertently ordered two arrived planned send one back set one acurites reading significantly different extech right didn know set second acurite read exactly first one seemed like pretty good indication accurate extech wasn extech consistently read humidity percent lower temperature degree higher acurites owned fourth moisture meter different brand one confirmed acurites would completely convinced accuracy don fourth meter however compare temperature reading moisture meter house thermostat accurites read exactly thermostat extech read higher given available evidence conclude acurite meter probably accurate extech not returning extech keeping two accurites way accurite one half size extech smaller display le obtrusive unit
come un calibrated adjustment screw didn move bought dollar one garden store thats better
returned first one could not calibrate extech cal kit replacement not work better able adjust unit displayed humidity close standard unit calibration screw nothing
purchased home florida order maximize ability monitor humidly compared unit min max dewpoint display combined brand name promising however poor experience similar another review unit display lower unit read within no problem thought use calibration screw adjust well screw inoperable no impact display value thanks amazon great return policy defective item way back stick lower cost accurate unit available
humidity calibration doesn work reason spend extra money unit no big surprise given made china
put low humidity environment still show cannot detect humidity lower
alarm doesn work correctly posted never case didn need function kept data displayed accurate
like another reviewer unable calibrate unit could adjusted no higher rh multiple salt test keeping large display responsiveness guess math head price hoped
bought amazon calibrated four temperature accuracy consistently read within acceptable limit however one unit cannot adjust relative humidity cannot correct humidity reading adjustment dew point reading depends upon accuracy relative humidity dew point error need good dew point reading prevent mold air handling equipment unit force guess error estimate dew point not good feeling people might think three four not bad don see put time trouble caused poorly manufactured tested product one star le could
year first seemed compare well two humidity sensor time humidity reading drifted downward read low compared sensor reviewer reported humidity calibration screw not work unlike temperature calibration screw work fine echo suggestion made another reviewer buy check operation calibration screw right away instead waiting need use mine screw covered small foam pad peel don make mistake trying adjust nearby phillips head screw hold case together would expected better extech
disappointed find calibration product ineffective pot potentiometer humidity adjustment continuously turned either clockwise counter clockwise no stop either direction full turn quiet click heard also worrisome impossible tell maximally minimally adjusted used calibration kit http www amazon com gp product b ubla ref os product test item half turn pot adjustment period hour half turn produced reading could never get read granted calibration kit made testing item difficult plastic bag come small hold entire item put probe bag sealed well could put item plus kit plastic bag another larger plastic bag sealed completely allowed longer adjustment period departure recommended procedure feel adjustment period suggested calibration kit hour unnecessarily long given quickly monitor responds change extech make calibrators don require machination absurdly expensive use another maker calibration kit may throw reading doesn change fact monitor cannot reliably adjusted manufacturer technical service person not helpful acknowledged pot no stop insisted effective anyway not finding keeping item using knowledge percentage point low least low range anyone know monitor accurate would appreciate hearing response posting trigger alert also not matter unit received black silver no green piece illustrated page
unit le month quit working tried different battery etc no avail obviously would not recommend product
not whole lot say dew point nice feature however trust reviewer correct western humidor calibrator iii way accurate bought caliber seems lot responsive probably indeed accurate
live sao paulo brazil wanted third themometer higrometer monitor temperature humidity apartment higrometer doesn match reading two difference percentual point called humidity calibration adjust doesn work two week suddenly temperature reading jumped fixed value degree celsius degree farenheit tried temperature calibration adjust also fake doesn work pity product good looking quality not built disappointed purchasing product give one star rating zero not accepted system
compared unit western humidor caliber iii hygrometer tested controlled environment humidipak calibration kit caliber iii unit dead surprised since paid extech extech calibration screw back tried calibrating match hygrometer screw doesnt even anything pointlessly turn temperature however accurate final thought buying another caliber iii hygrometer returning one caliber iii accurate within relative humidity

received item promised no problem
get pay seems thing flimsy view disposable item came screen already falling rim plus bent boot straight box never buying item advise
somewhat fragile distorted shipping otherwise fine
flimsy guess job bought original ge sure sturdy heavy duty
quality price could lower
supposed
look like original flimsy easily bent shape fit guess recommend original filter came stove hood wash dishwasher keep no one see old one tarnished
not exact fit caloric no grommet center dome deep checked detail saw others old range hood exhaust fan said worked
fit space hood slightly bent took box easy put back shape noticed mesh screen didn fit well edge piece good enough
shallow filter hit bottom fan motor buy genuine ge filter ge hood
didn fit application cost almost return purchase picture band secure end none included package arrived quickly expected return policy fair not worth
hose took almost extra week get hose self flimsy supposed come clamp attach dryer never arrived opinion not worth time order
bought three hose inexpensive toy two ferret not rate intended us main problem no matter much cut protruding wire manages keep coming however tube sort durable furries not chew
would not fit portable air conditioner
would given star hose deserves however per photo expecting white clamp included not disappointing
cheap plastic ended keeping dryer hose much durable thicker white plastic could poke finger one easily someone else said packaging specifically say not good high heat not really good use dryer hose
not dryer vent learned getting move looking dryer vent could fire hazard used dryer
complete fire hazard ask home inspector not use dryer dryer fire common use want house burn
small ferret actually considered underweight vet
listed dryer vent not mean clothes dryer package clearly state not hot air venting returned
say package isn recommended hot air use listed dryer vent hooked emergency replacement spend money metal vent hose well
okay thin material ended buying rigid piece lot money don think would last long term note intended use replacement portable air conditioner needed vent hose sure would fine vent hose bathroom fan similar not portable ac not issue smell unwrapped outside let sit day
plastic thin wire easily poke also didn intend purchase plastic vent tube didn notice plastic opened package bought use clothes dryer exhaust probably bit hot material ended throwing purchasing metal one home depot oops
purchased dryer read package opening said x found not true opened x could gone local hard ware store completely useless
no zip tie included despite picture
no clamp buck shouldn surprised guess
ferret love love se wire poking entrance cut poor baby wire cutter job still shouldn first place
don buy cheap plastic line sprung micro leak completely ruined drop ceiling tile basement soaked rug second time go copper save headache replace junk installed le one year later failed installing copper line time fool not
self tapping valve no punture tip
wasn needed plumber install
install kit not seem come everything needed install water line securely got work buy item secure line end since come not hold secure enough pressure decent money not well designed
connector worked many attempt plumber tape overall not worth hassle spend buy real copper also convinced plastic making water taste weird
compression valve broke rather easily connection fridge leaked week
worked
saddle clamp never managed good seal ended call plumber fix
look like would work didn need
don think crank tubing get water flow without leakage no way connect tubing fitting without tubing slipping included hardware doesn fit tubing way stay secure decided get fluidmaster im ice maker connector braided stainless steel compression thread x compression thread ft length instead much better solution
started leaking month
worked expected installation breeze remove day later though water came ridiculously slow really trickle morning water bottle three minute fill beyond stunted level patience replaced sharktooth copper coupling pex work great
first valve would not thread properly bracket wrap around copper pipe run home depot seek alternative option low behold product available big box store le money bought knowing didn thread right could least return unlike one bought second valve barely thread thru bracket managed make work getting installed fitting hold plastic tube started leaking eventually found different brand kit not leak avoid item quality poor
don know keep trying use plastic supposedly watertight connection brass ferrule kit deform shape compression fitting saddle tee never stop leaking seeping despite tried twice new ferrule compression nut however important deficit small hole made supply line saddle tee needle not allow enough water flow addition icemaker water dispenser fridge observation confirmed plumbing supply counterman finding ole brass x x compression union tee well nigh impossible watt make nylon one leak workarounds use tee union metal valve sharkbite work
thing product work fine enough essentially no instruction hard read unclear
leak no matter little tight cannot get hose attachment fridge side stop leaking useless
bought replace burst water line one burst within year finally went braided stainless water line haven problem since would never use anything stainless braided water line
hurry purchased kit another project knew wouldn using saddle valve later realized tubing purchased couple buck literally local home improvement store many higher quality valve used place saddle valve quality tube valve good
used foot polyethylene tubing refrigerator worked fine several year one morning walked kitchen find floor covered water tubing developed pinhole leak thought fluke cut section hole reattached fridge several month later another pinhole leak replaced pex line based experience would use pex copper line
like others said outer dimension line not large enough make seal slow drip saddle valve line pop control valve pressure not surprising since line easily pulled hand even really cranking connector go get copper line better connector edit gave kit extra star due fact valve actually work fine even price isn terrible value similar part similar price local big box store
disappointed product taken advice reviewer account first problem handle saddle valve broke trying tap copper pipe ended drill tiny hole use plier tighten saddle valve second problem compression fitting not tight tiny slow leak even tried adding pipe clamp really seal hose outside diameter small make even hose clamp work pro product would line certainly long enough course relative tapping water line location refrigerator fitting right size hooked fridge con cheaply made fitting junk water leaking since don time replace yet setup quart plastic container connection catch leaking water leak slow emptying water every day quart annoying least working ice maker middle summer going cut loss go lowe highly rated simple install line brother said took minute new line require cut piece copper pipe saddle valve line
way tapping waterline stupid better conect valve sink there no need tap behind valve sink
instruction not clear way assembly component water tight connection ended throw away couldn get water tight connection
purchase not go well replace several metal part able install water line inexpensive item didn bother returning ended spending almost much original purchase new part plus time go hardware store
job lot blood sweat tear took forever needle puncture copper pipe probably spent minute twisting crank went far hook electric drill rig crank eventually got pipe pierce went back cranking hand putting significant pressure crank not easy process bright side probably burned calorie not problem installation work like charm hindsight would probably pipe install inline shutoff safety purpose though
got kit replace old copper line ice maker cracked sustained pin hole leak got installed fine took hour messing compression fitting realize wouldn get tight enough hold tubing place compression fitting seem built sleeve no matter hard tightened would not crush line secure place like finally went hardware store replaced compression fitting use nylon ferrule crush tube lock place worked fine believe reason several review stating kit leak end make sure either replace fitting installing give nice tug tube turn water back ensure fact secured place
three thing leaked fridge line connected thought hooking wrong went got replacement part local hardware store stopped leaking icemakers fridge water dispenser need different method saddle valve not pierce large enough hole water flow enough icemaker take good minute fill glass water pieced copper pipe im going get tee valve provide adequate water flow instruction quite vague
issue many connector either end leak found video youtube http youtu qrqwfolhkvk look like assembling exact kit except video kit rubber ferrule sealing back connector video leave ferrule newer kit sort thing pro know either case recommend product don hate seems incomplete
supplied instruction adequate difficult understand got job done saddle went copper pipe perfectly not leak however connection refrigerator leak nothing could prevent lesson learned spend money better water kit
bought hook culligan water filter came right didn really want puncture copper line say get leak way ended going local hardware store not big box home improvement store getting advise worked nicely compression fitting tried use kit didn work well say don bother
got time got everything hooked leaked refrigerator buy extra fitting still leaked come find tubing not true inch fitting sent kit let water leak went back store bought tubing work thing work saddle piece attach water supply would not recommend anybody
review say direction not point got hooked problem tubing could not take water pressure running fridge even turned completely low kept popping eventually said get ended going bestbuy buying stainless steel product worked absolutely great waste money u product seems made secure except metal attachment cord meet
got kit install new refrigerator save store would charge plus get tap watt ro unit one complain hole punch tap water source not great small hole causing slow water flow refrigerator replaced watt pl push tee inch od work better still great price
leak water connection end tighten wright leak photo incorrectly show picture nut upside
would spend little extra money buy piece seperately hose low end would go braided stainless copper would not use hole puncture connection piece would get kind valve easy enough figure not handy homedepot guy common sense figured come mutch better kit

not fit vicks steam humidifier advertised cut make fit unsatisfied
false advertisement doesn work vicks germ free humidifier big annoying paid ship don want hassle return cut
pad recommended vicks model v series humidifier however need trimmed fit purchased size pad instead oh well live learn trimming easy scissors run humidifier would recommend changing pad every week mineral build various amount depending water source much easier clean small amount build weekly wait spend much time cleaning bigger mess le frequently
bought fit vicks warm mist uv germ free humidifer found much larger original pad came unit kept pad cut like customer worked ok however decided go without pad afterall clean unit time week following direction not huge deal read review closer would seen issue company delivered quickly marketplace order no complaint ordered wrong product therefore rate lower star error quick delivery

supposed fit humidifier doesn big cut able still fit compartment humidifier
ordered pad used past instead getting good quality honeywell pad got cheap flimsy pad said slant fin aftermarket pad refunded money admitted don actually stock sell honeywell pad listing due amazon mi match several day later see still listed selling honeywell pad recommend trying another seller
don buy mineral pad planning buying vicks uv germ free warm mist humidifier don fit unit might think based way product placed near vicks humidifier don big cost much return restocking fee paid
absorbed lot crud water replaced almost daily even using heating cup humidifier still became irreversibly caked mineral horrendously gross factor not worth hard water
pad work well didn like dirty box came fortunately pad plastic wrap inside box able use
work pretty good suppose well would work extra hard water may not changing enough direction not real clear
got wrong size pad looking smaller one work great keeping mineral water air
seems add lot loud gurgling sputtering sound humidifier couldn sleep humidifier
write said mineral pad would fit humidifier not large disappointing hardly seems worth trying send back price wasn bad tough shipping fast
good quality pad size wrong size unit yet recommended one vaporizer
nothing new report product using year variety humidifiers standard product kind expensive frequency usage needed
need trimmed fit others stated not sure would recomment purchase not due extra hassle
filter correct size wrong thought getting great deal pack arrived unfortunately pad much larger expected cut size use
say got fast not sure work humidifier though fault
use vicks machine cut easy enough job
pad large vicks uv germ free humidifer ordered incorrect pad unit honeywell humidifier believe pad would work well
typed vicks v pad one couple choice came seemed cheapest ordered however inch wide much thicker original vicks pad inch probably cut fit since not worth trouble return maybe try overnight vinegar soak original used one trick recommeneded number reviewer nb big vicks warm steam humidifier double tank model v obviously honeywell unit take larger pad
work well absorb mineral water last three day hard water area big vicks humidifier must trimmed
cannot make comment since not used yet not know attach

ordered advertised go vicks warm mist humidifier guess fault not researching assumed know joke since amazon advertised sold vicks humidifier would stuck heating element ruined never used heating element humidifier like said researched even tried cutting size didn work careful
though amazon place pad page vicks v warm mist humidifier hmp p mineral absorption pad large model didn really want rate since unable use

ordered pad thinking would fit vicks humidifier exact humidifier advertise buy pad received box doesn even say work vicks product way big say falsely advertised go hassle returning
never used no direction not fit anywhere humidifier sold waste money
job filter stick inside humidifier peel get dry
product recomended buy vicks humidifier not fit one trimmed fit
purchased vicks humidifier amazon offered pad humidifier bought together doesn fit don tempted buy pad separately
marketed replacement filter vicks model big measure vicks model requires filter not trying skew product rating merely trying warn considering product
don know must use pad not using month use obviously see get dirty time go unit also get dirty winter didn use pad realized unit get dirty amount speed
pad don seem much without calcium deposit gather metal plate supposed protect rate use manufacturer say need break bad habit rule follower seems best remedy would pour little vinegar water solution onto area let soak haven gut try yet warranty supposedly void use chemical not recommended manufacturer let know work warranty run mean time don waste money
product not recommended purchased alongwith honeywell hmw humidifier else ok
seem help collection mineral water use still pay attention scale build heating element not let build really hard remove use white vinegar least week clean soak heating surface also found come two pad together blocking water flowing heating area separated use one pad time
compact unit competitive pricing relatively quiet fast operation gallon capacity reduces frequency refilling simple touch control adjusting humidistat digital read duration operation rate humidity output useful feature unfortunately week intermittent use humidistat control malfunctioned contacted manufacturer pleased know repair replacement would not problem warranty experienced no problem unit proper maintenance required normal operation would recommend product anyone looking quiet effective reasonably priced humidifier
little mineral build adheres pad seems must float heating element build occurs heating element another percent building plastic surrounding heating element
bought honeywell humidifer bought unit easy clean don think need plus direction got said put heating coil didn want fear would heat unit ran dry maybe become harmful
trying figure exactly two week perhaps someday humidifier manual say humidifier run without clean unit frequently since water live hard clean unit twice week anyway run unit without tell much difference incidentally pad pick something since get hard chalky dry humidifier day not sure supposed get hard rock left pad week recommendation think would still mystery
ran unit without mineral pad honestly say not sure pad worthwhile unit seemed get dirty amount time

dryer vent hose doesn really stick vent pipe kit likely need put big metal hose clamp also lint tends blow tub without air diverter
product work advertised come mount hang canister wall cheap plastic clamp fasten tube dryer opted use higher quality metal one already lint escape reviewer noted likely cover nylon bag
served purpose not well crafted flimsy recommend using stocking cap hole keep dust coming hole
although accomplishes say personal situation left floor damp covered lint
plastic piece useless threw arrive time not satisfied product
think expecting little bit bigger dryer bucket haven really used look okay
would probably work well garage large open room laundry room became sauna could not used
provided tie strap hold connection dryer soon dryer start come going try using duct tape electrical tape hold

serf purpose disappointed construction vent hole let lint not sure efficient indoor use
work great downside house become humid expected importantly not lent trap house never dust lent flying around would better taking hose wall putting rubber band around end dryer sheet attached change dryer sheet every cycle work like charm
product decently built however would not use indoor situation even room fan put far much moisture product work time see problem moisture washer dryer garage not continue use fear ruining wall imagine would small indoor laundry room apartment
reason star not length hose install cannot go beside dryer floor riser control mean cannot mount unit certainly price low save venting outside since hose adjustable ft even meter would work installs foot sold used non usable band find hose short dryer install get new band new hose charge little make hose longer fit installs get cost le charge fit installs avoid sub happy rating
vent arrived quickly work relatively well would preferred quality construction even expensive installed day ago time tell work time
would well put stocking vent tubing let blow inside thing doesnt good job catching lint would better unit like seen flip damper summer let vent outside put kind filter catch excess lint
hoped would work not remodel dryer relocated away old vent outdoors contractor assured u would work read review still doubtful no real option made purchase installed directed yes flimsy water added base bow slightly round making difficult fasten top remove wall reattach lid air blow lint downward captured water remainder go everywhere room thankful closed laundry room door tried pantyhose cover trick mentioned yes work really sight two maybe three refill water evaporates snap lid base broke disappointed not doesn work still problem dryer lint cheap think not try go ahead keep track time frustration tell bargain better unit market
not see going prevent lint dust blowing laundry room ending house think increase amount time dust every week dusting soooo boring hose came nice eventually replace existing hose reason not return item ultimately put knee high nylon end existing hose plugged outlet outdoors main goal keep heat humidity house cold nothern winter
didn fit avanti dc dryer purchased not able attach hose dryer part stick dryer short silver tube little big couldn get nice tight connection sure work great didn work
needed indoor dryer vent would remove dust lint dryer exhaust wanted recover heat dryer not dust vent easy instal came everything needed get job done quickly tube nice flexible extendable add water lower section snap top section tube connects water lower section collect lint dust hole upper section allow fine dust escape pull lady knee hi nylon stocking top section cut end hole tube connects seems correct problem dry vent work cleanly perfectly
bought go new haier compact dryer live open apartment small dryer excellent lint screen built combined dundas jafine dryer vent kit acceptable situation fine lint escape even cut pair panty hose stretched open hole real cheaply constructed item not really worth charge best option indoor venting compact dryer get dust rag though need fine lint indoor venting isn really great way around use spariingly contractable clothes line strung across apartment heavier thing
must stretch stocking unit wall covered lint stocking got clogged lint needed cleared every load found messy difficult device nothing reduce humidity bucket water fancy top hold vent hose hired someone permanently vent dryer not permanent solution

seemed like good idea time read instruction discovered taken apart refilled water every dryer load much hassle
tried product exhaust outside approximately foot appliance technician measured air flow dryer outside found significant drop decided see indoor dryer vent would improve drying time item worked well except dust unbearable caused u try using stocking contain flying lint course reduced air flow remove product go provide filtering system flying dust could get used noise dust need contained
item work fine howevever buying experience thru deerso terrible paid extra expedited delivery shipped said would still seven day time ordered time got customer service people totally didn care never order anything thru deerso
look like good idea electric dryer don moisture problem house gas dryer would gas code dangerous gas dryer produce carbon monoxide colorless odorless bad not fatal

cheap plastic work thin plastic
dimension listed inside rather outside dimension pan would not fit closet
made brittle plastic one piece stacked washer dryer much weight lift slide tilted back slid far could lower washer back plastic pan cracked point water leak would not contained waste money would probably work fine lift washer slide way
don know happened measure x product dirty got since smaller anticipated take front facia freezer make work
give star using intended purpose set forget purchased cat litter tray handling cleaning time time currently litter tray chair mat basement kitty would occasionally miss clean runoff basement floor purpose plastic thinner hoped rim give rigidity side bottom slightly thicker plastic welch juice container may coat least side polyurethane something else not much weight provide reinforcement expect crack point anyway review probably not fair not using washing machine thought leave anyone else looking solution cat making mess glad purchased discount amazon warehouse

big opening side house
well made vent doesn clog like many others problem door flap wind incredibly annoying semi solved adding foam tape rim door quieted bit

got dishwasher satisfy wife get full sized appliance thought danby would good due small size water saving feature purchased september everyhting went fine month bit small normal sized plate seemed job oneverything else reason dishwasher got pissed started barfing place sort like cat apparently water shut valve broke kept filling water filling filling filling water counter cabinet floor finally found someone fix looking authorized repair center week least thought shop two month finally got back doesn work big paper weight sitting counter danby care nope told return got guess amazon won take don blame applicance worked month joke company won honor warranty period junk going become rifle target update different danby rep customer service going ship new machine wow first ne junk let see replacement machine thanks danby
loved danby crucial design flaw burning smell month couldn pinpoint turned danby thankfully caught caught house fire last wash wisp like burnt plastic started floating air around danby settled front dangerous research online find others similar fire problem obviously recalling countertop dishwasher product don know haven yet
first dishwasher sent blew literally plugged wall spark smoke galore returned sent new one seems working fine slight learning curve load machine get best result overall good investment roommate relation
lived tiny nyc apartment no dishwasher appliance really saved day however getting unit wasn defective bit challenge ended no fewer four dishwasher shipped two worked box died year use three arrived shipping damage one didn defective hosing wouldn attach unit latest danby countertop dishwasher expired move cross country something journey didn agree think water got electric sure thoroughly dry thing week ever move guess not sure next step big box retailer stopped selling mb manufacturer discontinued well godspeed decide buy guy
purchased dw target amazon leaked like sieve within hour amazon wonderful returning crediting charge card fifth danby dw three year work well break frequently service terrible nyc avoid also bought danby frig vacation home look great arrived damaged danby no help avoid rainbow appliance whose manager called liar reported damage
loved dishwasher due size price countertop dishwasher available tall fit cabinet however even though use every two three day month water coming window seal took window super glued seal window place luckily worked great seal around door came loose luckily able fix sadly almost year purchasing dishwasher began leak underneath cost diagnose repair would come close original purchase price goner really expected get longer usage time since never used sani mode usually ran shortest wash cycle combined using time per week used everyday full wash sani mode expect little dishwasher would never seen first birthday danby please step game
got small month worked great sometimes knob stick okay gasket around window started leak called email danby service department talked lady said send part said id serviceman look took gave man said make housecalls emailed back said warrenty would cover tryed call serviceman back two month later answer take info say hell callback okay warrenty info danby still waiting week window fall cant even use looking new dishwasher without window save money cause danby service suck
product didn work though given one star return process completely painless thanks amazon returned non functioning product received full refund
danby countertop dishwasher couple year mine model ddw w worked pretty well plastic window came loose apparently common machine danby instruction website fix glued window back scotch seal industrial sealant dishwasher back use like machine wish durable perhaps newer ddw w model little better built
don tall wineglass no coffee mug no least not rack seems made old fashioned china cup year past regular sized dinner plate no unit fit beneath cabinet take relatively small area lack height prevents many thing loaded machine dinner sized plate sort lay degree angle hope don fall still difficult thing clean hand drink glass mug cutlery cooking utensil like fit easily unit also turn feature sanitize dish get water extremely hot haven unit long enough comment leakage must say area might prone leakage appear relatively easy repair necessary sum not dream machine hoped worthy addition kitchen space cook lot
received item small dent top thought nothing shouldn affect performance thought plug everything machine make whirring noise no water spraying no movement dial optimistic minute gave returning back exchange crossing finger next box
worked ok month dial not exactly right notch washer run forever without stopping started leaking water everywhere obviously not able use product anymore good luck returning something size check return policy day taking item local repair center tomorrow warranty cover plastic part day electrical year not promising
fit older disposal system hole tight mean push muck drain water pool waste compost everything not huge problem annoying want dispose something without touching splash guard know picky know kinda gross
bought whirlaway disposal assuming exact replacement old one look similar silly turn much not rubber teeth smaller shallower angle le pliable result water won even drain close flow rate faucet totally normal residential faucet course forget anything solid going plunger even smallest debris baby given garbage disposal supposed make sink drain better feel pretty much nullifies advantage one using disposal without splash guard using sink stopper run would definitely not recommend splash guard edit bought nbsp data hook product link linked class link normal href waste king sink stopper splash guard ez mount disposers dp b dni ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf waste king sink stopper splash guard ez mount disposers seems work intended
disappointing flimsy doesn protect much splash doesn hold shape wear quickly seems amplify rather reduce disposal noise thought soft rubber design thing available year old sinkmaster disposal not rigid rubber choice general electric wc x direct replacement work better money
lasted four month curled
not thought
work new drop grinder area awhile
work baffle stiff food pas easily
not insinkerator fell disposal
problem soft many time get sucked disposal stop quickly rescue one time probably going get damaged one bought year ago think home depot worked fine starting broken bit one fit perfectly doesn stay place
ok rubber not thick last time bought item year ago kind disappointing since ordered
month started dissolve sticky tar like substance nasty
product right size job bit flimsier original doesn fit snugly original probably glue place pop turn garbage disposal not big deal though
garbage disposal splashguard garbage soft sucked disposal way often quality fallen acceptable level bought fine worked year still holding became worn dirty replacement failure beginning repeat bought worked reconsider buying quality changed worse
fit opening fine purchased universal one large hole sink tried one fit perfect not quality old one job
smaller hole fall well
not good fit sink bought supposed work brand sink small fall inside disposal
useless previous splash guard sink erator sinkmaster unit lasted year rubber finally breaking needed replaced one simply crap whole piece made thin soft generally flimsy rubber us maybe rubber old gasket used perimeter narrow rib doesn grip edge disposal well right size thing flimsy fold slip disposal whenever turn water annoying pull thing disposal whenever want turn carefully aim water center hole doesn fall back disposal running even bought back assuming would quality part based older review yet another case bait switch seems
flimsy rubber not solid previous one ordered used buy ordered exact product last time definitely not threw one still using old one disappointing new one
threw away week flimsy kept falling disposal unit
product good quality fall hole garbage disposal would great little bigger circumference fit better
difficult item find correct size model fit perfectly however soft pliable often fall disposal one day get munched not careful
fit whirlaway disposal sure way flimsier one replacing much get pushed disposal pushing vegetable clipping scrap could pull time replace kinda defeat purpose fished sucker many time time move different manufacturer
keep falling drain worthless
bought item mar replace older one lasted year one le month lost strenght jump sink disposal turned sometimes pay purchase original equipment
fit stiff everything plug making disposal constantly use utensil shove thing ground really annoying
fit perfectly except no lip prevent piece getting sucked disposer teeth retrospect poor design revised extended review
high hope softer splashguard much desired however not fit opening sink disposer
bought couple year ago able pull order reordered knew would get one fit garbage disposal could not believe difference two year make one flimsy hardly stay place lost several time disposal go fishing one got several year ago really firm sturdy put place stayed time bend like new water bottle no firmness disappointment bring back old one quality made
wrong size disposal difficult order online without seeing
good fit good stronger material seems slide opening instead staying place
product week inexplicably shriveled see picture first really happy good fit no product fail week reviewer say material thick inflexible exactly opposite problem manufacturer able get right anybody tell get better one fit
thin almost no resistance much thinner one wanted replace not use thin won prevent item passing
water not drain rubber hard
cheaply made flimsy looked old short time
work tends fall drain time
doesn fit snugly insinkerator disposal drain try push food becomes dislodged last thing want stick hand slimy drain retrieve
whatever made stiff not allow water drain properly
purchased product attempt save money low behold stiff brick everything get stuck smallest thing mostly food scrap cause sink clog force drain open spend little get one work
ruber pop fall turn disposal
arrived promptly fit great finding water doesn make opening well feel like garbage disposal sound like running dry need manually push open let water happens
trouble finding good replacement allows food easily fit use hand jam thing like egg shell splash guard disposal larger amount food pull replace get food original allowed food go disposal easily
fit perfectly firm stuff even smallest morsel drain hand
never recollection given negative review anything bought online object though sized appropriately sink fit snugly proper place no struggle lived around year damned irritating slows water drainage almost dead stop no matter disposal running not vane stiff something perhaps slot narrow center hole small something end use wooden spoon push food hole want normal drainage reach sink grab useless piece work tilt hole water pas around thing good somewhat muffling sound disposal replaced splashguard buying local outlet went business recently fine dont buy one read review star review see many others disappointing experience however thank whoever manglefractured one chance practice writing negative review yay whoopee ding
great price feature narrow passing water fast enough water go slowly
doesn fit waste king advertised big fit drain also flimsy price worth le pay ship back
not happy product going replace hole tight not allow good water flow constantly putting finger hold hole open
easy installation slide right slows water flow sink trim rubber flap bit get water airflow
month using rubber becomes hard stiff no flexible finger hurt stuck slot worse could fly grinding due rubber shrinkage
fit work
hot water seriously caused curl rendered useless
fit nicely garbage disposal liked price couldn believe didn needed hardware store good ole reliable amazon job keeping flatware unwanted item garbage disposal good job food scrap slow go well drain slowly sink fill water unless want push g finger utensil defeat court stand waiting take put back sink empty kind gross kind point maybe loosen use let know
stay place fine however flap sturdy allow water pas extremely slow don allow solid matter pas whatsoever usually take dish put back turn garbage disposal poor allowing anything pas
restricts water flow much leave sink place run disposal
nothing went drain tried cut still nothing went threw away waste money
not product pictured fit not drain well hole small
use not good original one water not go fast food not go easily cut extra slit first got seem fit snuggly seems like loose fall garbage disposal couple time got kenmore disposal year old
little three month rubber hardened curled actually making harder water flow guard hate
not fit wasteking indicated
not fit ended using insinkerator garbage disposal baffle perfect
item exact product waste king sink stopper probably won last long seems kind flimsy sell splash guard without sink stopper didn need another one
guard splashing hole small food foe not go well must pushed
not fit
not fit disposal
hoping oem like replacement ok not perfect water not drain fast enough not clogged drain issue older original one worked fine water drained skink drain older one fine new one not much like hole not big enough something used exact knife cut little hole outside perimeter little larger helped situation fit nice tight sinkmaster nice
poor design water not drain causing sink fill water
item needed cut lot allow water drain properly good keeping item unintentionally falling disposer sink always backed sink
not buy product unlike original whirlaway splash guard one leave segment far stiff result waste simply not go disposal unless force item finger absolutely maddening
slit aren big enough allow water thru hold something rubber water get thru
turn wrong one
perfectly good splash guard fit perfectly sinkmaster disposer however lack inner lip provided snug seal original stopper stopper sits loosely top splash guard held place water pressure water slowly drain leakage get worse rubber splash guard age
supposed
nt job
didn fit probably didn look close enough know universal fit
fit drain shield backwash disposal water going drain horrible maintaining flow pool sink no time flat drain guard much better job
not perfect fit work fine
awful not fit sink
order standard size ran small check size ordering llb
didn fit disposal thought disposal size apparently not probably mistake not reading fine print
fit sinkmaster drain correctly cutout tight drain hole also small every little thing get caught use wooden spoon poker every time turn faucet water doesn even drop hole well poorly designed clearly not like previous disposal guard purchased go back drawing board design lasco wanted catch screen stuff would buy one
splashguard not properly drain cause sink fill water frequently manually open splashguard allow water item flow disposal
although look like original equipment part came disposal unit made harder plastic make harder push anything sink least fit actually don mind try not use waste disposal trash receptacle catch thing scoop
fit like needed trim back flap get food go without manual force
definitely sturdy manually push every morsel food every time rubber not giving keep food splashing back sink keep spoon etc falling probably wouldn buy though
reviewer said baffle od outside diameter not od thus much wide told amazon basic info part one critical dimension
not read spec well enough splashguard way wide sink
not fit securely drain year old slide around try get thing disposal take work one replaced much better protective water barely drained
perfectly fit even small piece food continuously pushed guard disposing
using seems ok sometimes water doesn drain sink fast like hold water unless spray water drain full pressure run disposal fit sink good though doesn pop run disposal like one
slip around bit workable
fit sink perfect issue give unforgiving need push food manually made modification make better cut prong shorter cut prong closer edge however helped little definitely workable get pay
product information technical detail amazon webpage product dimension x x inch packaging dimension lasco splashguard actual diameter inch rim thickness inch also ordered wast king splashguard time found x inch size seems fit bunch garbage disposal including general electric gfc v splashguard found locally inch diameter prompted line search lasco splashguard fit hole center small allow waste pas without help course person could easily make bigger
wrong part doesn match decription item description much larger piece
item disappointing ordered splash guard perfect stopper ill fitting not seal well maintain water sink
sinkmaster disposer prominent model number information lasco part according needed replace stopper inexpensive time shipping included pretty steeply priced stopper even expensive turned inch shy diameter required double checked everything correct chucked stopper recycling bin bought one flat rubber thing reply water pressure hold place
said fit whirlaway tad small guess pull crazyglue try fix old one

couldn get fit onto drain pipe even cutting
originally impressed build quality hose today month use walked flooded laundry room moving washer away wall discovered hose developed several pin hole leak unhappy
everything seemed fine first installed easily trimming third end option fired washer leaked little pushed little harder resolved started soon water everywhere look connection see huge seam middle tube area would receive little handling either shipped defect gentlest contact caused rupture either way little faith product won replacing
flexible hose seems work properly hose clamp provided broken
package came open missing hose clamp one primary reason chose item plumber used one charged
wow price hose doubled last month
received product within day ordering well packed immediately upon opening box realized not like picture received coil element went ahead installed element don get anywhere near hot old coil one used fact put much heat original smaller coil not contacted seller replacement already used month wish would first open box product received not worth money
never got hot red old range element cook top ended not using putting broken old one back

arrived broken
work fine
didn fit burner think connector bit shorter mine
not bad
well figured burner tilt mentioned review one three arm shorter rest mean doesn reach way edge drip tray come rest little bit lower arm wish thought manufacturer defect believe deliberate design make sure burner fit little small might go unnoticed little big wouldn reason undecided whether send back mean chance next one won problem burner not completely unusable heavy enough pot one rough bottom stay put aluminum frying pan fry unevenly keep drifting one side
burner shorted no longer worked month cheap good

work pretty good would liked better one price little high work okay guess
particular size wobbly not understand either kenmore drop range needed new one however unstable number turn different likely since one circle metal smaller hence move weight full size skillet didn notice much canner board full quart tomato keep bacon egg save life looking kenmore whirlpool oem stuff replace also bought smaller replacing four okay great price work hence two star honestly post cheer happy cooking
undercarriage issue leg long don fit kenmore pan maybe pan not set flat stove top quality control please spend couple buck get guess

bought replace quiet collar sink year smelled annoying opening aren large enough sink start fill water time would not buy
terrible cause water food back sink look another model one doesn work advertised
watch measurement one although answered question product material say fit standard sink drain found perhaps millimeter two big sink cause rubber bunch clearly not correct fit different make disposal ridge bottom drain disposal connects metal sink bottom existing cheap corroded back splash collar currently rest
product fit didn adequately let water flow sink water would back unless forced opening wider trying push food disposal pain well
paint chipping within week instalation
quiet food doesn go disposal without prodded
reviewer correctly stated water not drain appears much rubber plan trim reading review something incorrect design
seem two kind people written comment product think greatest thing since sliced bread think stupid design hole isn big enough let water drain freely true hole significantly smaller original baffle come insinkerator among think stupid design know use scissors don hole formed four piece soft rubber straight edge opening snip piece four quick snip well
big fit sink drain hole went ace hardware got one cheap work fine
appears larger average garbage disposal opening not fit sink useless need disappointed
baffle came new insinkerator evolution constant feed disposal terrible design opening way small water doesn even drain fast enough pool sink instead dumped bowl daughter cheerio sink not one cheerio made drain old badger never problem contacted insinkerator said water pooling normal reduce sound use utensil push food turn use hand really constant feed disposal need use hand utensil push food water looking different baffle like badger fit sink
not fit sink returned back
disappointed product first drain way slowly original piece secondly quickly got covered slimy moldy stuff much quickly original one
use disposal place remove easily though
didn fit garbage disposal
got insinkerator evolution worst feature new garbage disposal barely drain water impossible waste get past literally need push waste past spoon replacing soon
super quiet doesn really drain seems get clogged time invite unsafe behavior
not fit sink size standard sink erator
doesn fit standard sink wanted return go return cost shipping back money don buy
didnt end using drain cover didn fit drain bought premier copper product dc orb drain didn see make work together
water barely drain
not installed new gasket yet stopper purchased done trick keeping water sink
not fit garbage disposal complete waste money
replacement look much better one downside none food automatically slide use hand get collar sink rather unfortunate
make water drain slow quiet
design focused sound insulation sacrificing water food flow want sink constantly back pushing food item collar manually mean buy got free new disposal absolutely stand single pea block drainage
truly believe product achieves star understand designed pool water thereby dampening sound motor cost much rather cope decibel noise wash dish pool dirty water food particle large single basin sink simply awful water drain left spray particle drain several time sink clean literally surprised poor design often find wondering insinkerstor realize bad new better design magically show unsolicited mailbox
spent hp evolution series disposal disposal fantastic rubber baffle horrible bad water wasn going thought slow running pipe turn baffle orifice also tighter old style baffle food sits top baffle unless jam utensil carefully need go back drawing board one
not work pro evolution disposal
opening tiny nothing go without pushing even pea get stuck water faucet build drain opening fast enough steer clear one hopefully get one like original
disposer powerful quiet drainage problem collar totally unacceptable per suggestion enlarging vent hole cut v two hole toward center line underside rubber helped not enough cut slit way four sloping section used regular hand held paper punch make hole top slit drainage much better disposal still quiet
water flow major problem
perfect fit strong enough prevent light weight object falling well preventing splash ups
bought one loved wanted new fresh one ordered not item picture mine thinner no step like ridge flap thin flat rubber fit loosely hate not muffle sound well called amazon fabulous gave refund even though torn package open well thought thing liked afraid order another one maybe manufacturer changed design although part number don make good one anymore not happy
fine except bit flimsy small fall disposal yes insinkerator original one lasted several year almost never slipped sturdier one available
not drain water fast enough even cut rubber others done still drain slowly replacing different baffle
really baffle noise material thick push food get disposal suppose one not
review already said doesn drain well often push food get go drain really quiet cost pushing hand utensil get food would not buy plan trim back rubber make drain better
whatever sink baffle
yes make thing bit quieter no miracle product nasties still grow design food particle don move freely constantly spread apart rubber finger get food go disposal
even not catch debris insert badly slows drainage water cause backup dirty water sink also catch hold debris get drain chopped disposal made hard inflexible material make difficult clear not good product
product came new insinkerator disposer new sink little know researched disposer cover advance collar cause water back sink drain slowly plumber say way product work wrote insinkerator got back saying designed pool water top reduce noise motor call pooling call water backing sink make prep work cleanup inconvenient annoying insinkerator not yet responded question replacement cover allows water flow directly drain meanwhile advise not purchase product insinkerator disposer equipped
come standard insinkerator evolution simply worst design imagine hole middle inch diameter water not even flow pushing waste paste almost impossible tried insinkerator rsb oo removable sound baffle amazon replacement work perfectly measure inch diameter
believe designed trap layer water sink noise kept minimum real world result water food waste not drain timely manner leaving soupy mess dish unless physically open rubber drain hand utensil would gladly trade little noise good draining sink long run garbage disposal anyway minute right buying regular baffle replace one hope getting sink back
device catch kind food particle underside seem ooze together nasty bad smelling slime removed clean find kind nook cranny almost impossible get cleaned scrub toothbrush really bad design also seems trap food particle tube drain attache garbage disposal run brush around area also clean smelly goo yuck
version quiet collar received excel model poorly engineered not drain water properly regular use water kitchen sink would start fill first thought clogged drain line removed collar voila water drained fine boat pardon pun advised insinkerator send alternate collar drainage problem advise contact company guess original collar supposed use layer water muffle sound engineered poorly
baffle came sink disposal bought new house cannot get anything liquid go thing without pushing bit food really tedious awhile want rinse plate go disposal maybe defective not installed properly yanked plan get plumber install normal baffle annoying
baffle not fit sink opening guess thought size standard didn cost enough go trouble returning cleaned old one really well installed new sink
part fit perfectly extremely happy month used baffle needing replace outside rim become ruffled not fitting flush tight inside drain used consequently food get caught baffle drain opening get nasty quickly purchase new baffle not sure go particular one really liked worked side ruffled tempted try not sure happened cause think anything unusual different event circumstance would rated star change fit happened
opening soo tight take get food drain however better wide
wrong diameter need one exactly across advertised fir model not
item came evolution excel noise low no splash back however not drain well disposal not use sink would begin fill water unless disposer pushed edge baffle allow air bubble water drain closer inspection noticed two top slot baffle not nearly big one picture animation not sure manufacturing defect think not matter took exacto knife made slot big possible like picture drain well docked two star modify product supposed configuration get drain normally
sure fine product insinkerator disposal flange brand disposal red herring not essential element brand flange insinkerator disposal thought baffle would fit spent quite time struggling trying make work found opella disposal flange insinkerator disposal needed opella baffle slightly smaller instead say match disposal flange not model disposal
disposal cover year wore order one arrived found well made plastic cover drain hole cut noise work much better easy clean le half price would not order insinkerator collar
unfortunately sink baffle not fit disposal sink recommendation make sure check model ordering
contractor didn use look package not worth price send back
nothing wrong product one included insinkerator really wasted money buying another one list everything included anything needed not included
careful purchasing product garbage disposal part not universal interchangeable red product perfect shape bought wrong size
description sizing not explicit enough guage whether not fit one item ever gotten amazon disappointed
exchanged similar one year wife hate say slower old one thought blunt
ordered replace one thought worn work way original not solve problem water doesn drain easily baffle set inner ring either take partially make grinding noise almost unnoticeable though
fit drain fine new design splash guard narrow throat sink drain food waste doesn fall splash guard drain easily used little annoying manageable

actually relatively well made product sturdy rubber like material fit well replacement deteriorated oem splash guard star rating based fact water not seem able drain guard well full sink run water forcefully water simply cannot drain guard likely due fact material not flexible enough imagine trying drain sink small center hole material flexible weight water would depress flap around edge center hole like oem guard water would drop guard unfortunately not case requires pull guard allow rapid drainage water sink overall work reasonably well inconvenience pull keep inserted sideways e not flush disposal opening prevent water pooling sink unfortunate
way stiffer original feel like plastic rubber amazon double check supplier distributor hoping would soften month not gonna try find alternative

not fit like original cap pop water sink discharged probably buy different disposal one quits
way stiff purpose like idea splash guard replaceable one stiff wife won even use
stopper drain fit correctly stopper hold water well drain portion tight must help open water drain sink also not nearly good quality original overall work
splash guard work fine probably continue work fine month disposal warranty decade longer expected people need dozen life disposal stopper hand might last long disposal waste king could packaged three pack could left stopper completely sold separately instead assure buy three splash guard buy three stopper people never use stopper dishwasher don need fill sink regular basis even occasional one many new stopper person need reason buy individual vacuum cleaner bag even individual vacuum cleaner belt selling one alone doesn make much sense begin selling stopper make even le sense

thought needed go waste king didn don buy waste money
see
not stay
reason won hold water sink
small opening return
wemt woth disposal bought no good
difficult get food hole disposer not stiff
food doesn pas easily
plastic item never loosens month toooo stiff allow food go pull every time juice get garbage disposal area time coffee ground bridge opening tried trim plastic around hole didn work must say better old one almost chewed
unfortuneately stopper not fit neck disposal chute require one tad smaller
use no value clutter sink counter top needed use
splash guard not fit snugly sink therefore isn great maybe larger diameter would perfect
splash guard work fine stopper cheaply made won seal really don recommend stopper
included waste king disposer kit unnecessary purchase cost return equal price item could saved money
simply extra part ordered ordered waste king disposal unit could replace part without reordering needed
purchased replacement original original stiff don let food go drain always shove spoon get food go wast king make great disposal interface don like
mentioned prior review part poorly designed often splash guard must removed put waste splash guard reduces noise water splash could not recommend product don appear reasonable alternative
not need additional part gave repairman stash part better info disposal would helpful
gave product star rating probably like star well work perfectly waste king unit dramatically cut noise never anything fly disposal thing tight water often trouble going example pour waste veggie turn water veggie don weight go flap sit water pool end remove splash guard hand let everything drain replace splash guard use disposal world splash guard guess don guard enough allow extra noise possibly splashing occur others let nothing pas would clearly nothing pass category not bad product may need trim plastic lip order work properly
thing called guard stopper think whoever designed forgot another functionality required not supposed guard stopper way prevent water stuff splash disposer perfectly ok even must let water go way obviously not case thing trying cut different part several time let water go little bit got improved still not even close original waste king splash guard btw simply not want sit place therefore required replacement still not sure whether worth get bad substitute
purchased use waste king ok tight fit drain slowly due size center hole simply cut inch tip flap allow better drainage work ok although thinking worth around rather paid
wasted money not need popped purchased still not need not purchase included waste king disposal
getting water drain required manual intervention even cut four flap back half inch still manually widen opening get water drain normally
place splash guard opening water won go use turn disposer choice disposer inconvenient
replaced original fit perfectly slightly different original waste king disposal came think hole smaller sink seems drain much slower think survive however
work two month finger center start open let particle come disposal running would recommend reservation hope little better product not found yet
wanted echo others wrote water go guard slowly push food waste past really idiotic design wish one could get splash guard came disposal worked fine may try modify one scissors work better
doesn allow item flow
descriptuion product self not appear include item youy not need installing new waste king l
great able find replacement however stopper fit splash guard cheapened original constructed plastic steel rubber seal around circumference sealed extremely well inside dimension rubber splash guard seems many company day cheapened stopper plastic work seeming seal not well said still better clunky universal deal sell lowes hd
not sure would different one came garbage disposal reviewer mentioned hole small push food hole nothing bigger crumb make way positive side le likely accidentally lose something drain would prefer food make way disposal ease
wouldn let food water drain maybe hole small cut way bit still push food water hand not good idea unit stiff allow weight food even water pas bought replace original one waste king disposal thinking manufacturer would making function well product
meh fit doesn flex well let food water constantly taking let food fall even tried trimming away let water drain better
bought recommended amazon disposal disposal already come read others review first
purchased one came waste king got really gross hard clean thought price could order new one every year really really wished not thrown old one away first thing frustrating nightmare first opening way small nothing mean nothing go accord not even oatmeal also way stiff thought might loosen age actually gotten stiffer everything want disposal must pushed hand big spoon every time hate passion make sink messy using otherwise superior disposer real chore unfortunately don think another alternative waste king make one came last long possible
not sure ever needed second part original vanishes always spare
part also came waste king not needed also shouldn recommended add revenue come unit
look like old one tight fit fact wrinkle forced fit sink opening tad tight
originally impressed quality item seemed solid substantial placed drain noticed problem slide place fine tightness fit cause finger splashguard pressed tight together fitment cause water not drain properly hole middle not sufficient prevent water backing drain leaving food particle sink surface rather going drain stopper cheaper part came originally waste king disposal original rubber flange around edge creates nice tight seal prevent water draining sink new stopper stop water fitting within inner diameter rubber splash guard much difficult get place get seal properly water doesn drain supposed drain isn pretty ironic huh
fit fine water doesn drain sink use manufacturer issue need fix
sinkmaster special edition model need splash guard replaced every month otherwise becomes loose keep popping bought per sinkmaster exact match not happy first rubber finger thicker not nearly pliable previous replacement stopper came happens food waste pile top doesn fall unassisted weight use spoon fork push food finger create much backwards resistance trying withdraw utensil pop splash guard compared replacement bought previously circular fit way loose not near enough resistance keep splash guard positioned throat like possibly different supplier made lesser quality material le dimensional accuracy don know possibly old stock past shelf life bought three like buy ahead time regret decision may go ahead try cutting finger improve ability pas food waste well wrap outer diameter teflon similar tape increase frictional hold
keep food splashing splash guard also trap water food whatsoever sitting difficult shove food splash guard push wooden spoon sponge pretty hard get food spoon sponge get stuck splash guard pull splash guard come sink altogether maybe made flexible material not sure solution
ok ordered separate not realizing garbage disposal included saving backup disposal seem fit better pinch
didn need themthey included disposal purchased wasn rue included didn want pay excessive shipping cost weren ordered separately
received part worked fairly well month use part experienced dimensional instability shrunk bit retired rubber plastic engineer clear part taken set reduced dimension never seal dis allow water passage direct result composition compound used molding part possibly combined mold size shrinkage removal mold
don think needed part included disposal advice said purchased others ordering disposal
sale add indicated additional stopper seal necessary complete installation however included disposal totally unnecessary purchase add also stated low price item shipping shipped item decided send separately disposal charge double shipping charge
buying waste king l continuous feed disposal already included work look cheap
waste king disposal come thing box don waste extra money purchase already buying waste king disposal
splash guard purchased one specific vendor not work properly bad imitation stiff water not flow causing sink fill
bought replacement installed easy enough good thing rubber hard easier remove use garbage disposal trying force debris
splash guard great idea use sink stopper time take splash guard put stopper visa versa
happy fit drain fine shove food disposal think poorly designed disposer
professional plumber hired would not install disposal accessory stated product plastic part easily break
purchased new box waste king came necessity yay didn spend money return could use later maybe
ordered garbage disposal suggested order assumed thesis part didn come disposal didn need return don suggest thing not needed
sure fine product stuff came waste king thus completely unnecessary not like thing wear fell people bought wast king also bought ordered yikes
work fine noisy plumber say replaces lot due plastic drain cracking breaking careful not apply pressure drain
ordered spare quality bit lacking drain plug us gasket keep coming grove plug
presented amazon necessary adjunct purchase waste king disposer came part price not worth sending back save case need line poor information
came recommended since purchased disposer didn fit didn even want u bother sending back
guard not good alternative mesh cover time plastic wear not stop anything falling disposal long thin object spoon etc fall right
couldn believe lightweight insubstantial cheap fit however quality equivalent toy cereal box thankfully not expensive item discarded
fit nice snug like last one little loose would occasionally pop however make water drain slowly get obviously going obstruct water flow still think could modified allow little water flow either way get job done
amazon dishonest description product first time purchased item indeed oem manufactured waste king poor imitation belongs garbage part garbage disposer additionally amazon sent laser ship left package unprotected outside vestibule instead opening screen door past left package mailbox curb no matter many complaint amazon get laser ship refuse stop using
waste king not popular sink disposal although costco amazon carry disposal not appear local source worn part really translates splash guard stopper internals not appear replaceable since amazon carry part reasonable cost easy enough order part easy replace although not feel sturdy leading expect replacement regular basis splash guard easily deformed due thin construction planned obsolescence appears thus three star several month use thin construction deformed need replacement ordering soon original review stand recommend waste king disposal order every six month covered
duplicate previous wiastking review original waste king disposer information lead thinking extra piece needed istallations not true disposer come compleate doesn need extra part operate
really needed another stopper since get falling disposal bought replace even smaller old one problem
part fit disposal could bit robust month petal center strainer warp twist leave gap look kind like flower close le opening new let noise make harder put item disposal
economical doesn stop water draining sink replacement splash guard worth purchase price stopper doesn work
splash guard stopper set not produced waste king would expect product title made company called anaheim manufacturing california although part work waste king disposal not identical original somewhat misleading include word waste king product title corrected make clear replacement part manufactured third party

thought would getting classier version disposer sink stopper would match stainless steel sink better wrong exact black piece come disposal rip not even worth energy return think really unethical dumb amazon post false picture item today show grey stainless steel colored item set total bait switch amazon fix considering whether not trust future purchase amazon misleading picture not happy
spash guard come waste king gabage disposal unit protects backplash food item well however hole food go sink small use tool push food also look see food ground sent disposal unit addition nearly imposible retrieve item accidently gone sink would recomment looking another splash guard compatible disposal unit

order another one cooled degree see nd one
purchased machine didn realize one tank could sit year get stagnant moldy really messed
unfortunately found quite fragile wet careful open machine clean reposition
aircare filter packaged folded need inserted circle haven tried others recommend antibacterial additive air begin smell without
bought like entertain large party thought novelty keg beer would easy serving clean used twice could not get regulated correctly beer foam real disappointment keg fit better unit keg usually not enough beer party
sent part don line missing lot stuff instruction not clear
package damaged seems common theme marked fragile husband excited anyway looking forward working sending unit back hoping replacement work kegarator not cold keep beer warm would great hoped not pay beer go skink not worth keg showed dent corner thought well not big deal keep beer cold feel differently hoping replace bring back faith hope better news replacement say accommodating agreeing replace current item
owned kegerator month still foamy beer great post different item try super helpful going one done several experiment reduce eliminate amount foam limited success first thing thermostat coldest got temp degree followed helpful youtube advise fluctuates degree additionally added water bottle minimize much fluctuated next experimenting pressure even lowering psi still get inch head bear pour even pour consecutive beer no longer pour pint glass use super large tall glass otherwise half beer foam minor adjustment helpful wrapping hose top keg important not let line dip top keg another source foam told point considering taking connection apart starting scratch gone pony keg best solution come pouring growler first careful purchasing product may work awhile get good glass beer update month purchasing extreme temperature variation without opening door range degree degree
change part accommodate keg use buy another would spend extra money get one material like keg included also co tank exchanged since made china no inspection stamp hard find someone fill ended getting pound cylinder exchange
tap handle tendency pull hard constant issue regulator diaphragm gasket getting cold sticking use relief reset doesn release gas take regulator let sit get room temperature install work fine go back temp temp fridge held around f reason keep co tank back shelf intended temperature adjustment seems work fairly well like hold full half barrel
chasing co leak like reviewer stated co regular came also not regulate well not consistent already upgraded kegco regulator still ran tank co continue trouble shoot
kinda suck doesn get cold not long enough beer line instruction don make sense
getting money worth kegerator apparently requires two thing knowledge kegerators put together want take apart cleaning instruction no help whatsoever intent pour beer tap least every day occasional beer drinker like find tap handle stick easily pouring beer still possible effort year infrequent use tap handle kegerator broke half keg beer sitting inside refrigerator inaccessible buy new faucet assembling kegerator first received not without challenge duck billed washer came restricted flow beer trickle internet research learned washer supposed slit used razor blade cut one not easy washer small little margin error beer able flow freely finding right co pressure actually rather frustrating burned first co canister fairly quickly may leak somewhere connection never found first keg produced beer weren excessively foamy second keg second co canister better least handle broke worked right kegerator great time far
terrible waste time money beer won get colder degree max cool setting shipping back tomorrow buying different brand
product came completely damaged mold tap box torn seemed like part thrown fridge door tapped seeing hinge also broken no bag nutts bolt either literally everything thrown fridge
mt first one came dented door returned replacement one massive dent corner won fall ill returning finding another kegerator

reading several review felt kegorator fairly safe bet receiving kegorator assembled fired heard little bit sound click nothing several attempt apparent compressor shot sent unit back no problem easier expected downside package everything within day received new kegorator cool not fast shelf unit jammed rung damaging inside wall exposing foam decided ignore issue repair damage getting keg filling co etc quickly realized co regulator not regulating nothing went local welding shop purchased new regulator worked expected regulator work end kegorator work fine cheap part faulty part make kegorator failure spend extra different kegorator avoid headache
initially posted review one week stating happy far kegerator three month say spent money better kegerator unit loud come pound co tank hard find someone refill swap pounder becasue would big fit kegerator first keg beer refilled tank time far slow leak system somewhere unable detect coming not lack trying kegerator not ability make internal external co tank like kegerators market cumbersome also difficult regulate foam keep temp no matter co pressure use get ton foam time end craigslist looking buy kegerator make sure get unit come lb tank mounted inside fridge one quieter one

cheaply made grease screen installs bend get holding clip grease screen installed loose fit gap not catch grease light bulb shield cheap plastic one two cleaning broken would not buy
first give unit two star work pull lot air worked u since recently light bulb failed however bulb difficult change apparently designer not concerned maintainability light go good luck changing light difficult remove impossible get good grip bulb bare hand bulb smooth help line recommended use material could give u good grip company ship tool unit make removing bulb easier used large rubber band gave little bit grip bulb stuck tight together odd angle forced grab bulb barely able put enough torque bulb furthermore unit sound like aircraft engine
reason unit loud two setting high high would use often reasonable low setting use really loud interrupt talking tv etc kitchen nearby area use bad really like look

well made doesn completely seal drain insinkerator brand disposal half full sink drain couple minute inexcusable
wife loved plug first got however month ago small rubber seal started coming loose didn always seal properly finally came enough no longer usable
although item currently get job done cheaply made stopper wobble position device constantly move dish no confidence stand repeated use

arrived dameged
bought product approx year ago thought great however within month basically died lcd would not work thus useless new battery would not resurrect thing
alarm go freezer degree need go freezer go
not good alarm sound freezer not range specified unit even temp colder
bought two one work fine one alarm went no matter temperature freezer sent back promptly sent replacement thing going get refund one handle shipping return nicely
know price would piece crap thought heck complex little digital thermometer well one work ok thermometer haven verified temperature accurate seems work ok however alarm doesn work well bought monitor upright deep freeze case power went circuit tripped etc turn alarm seems go cold temperature well warm cold seems like anything maybe f alarm go freezer normally run f f alarm constantly useless turn thing cord probe little big diameter cause little leak door seal make bunch ice frost freezer worsens seal probably ditching temp gauge altogether
main reason buying let know without opening door cold deep freezer turn brand new frigidaire special sucker seal close door start actually suck air gasket seal trying suck door shut tight provide airtight seal guess thing wire coming outside across rubber gasket door probe inside freezer make small gap seal week came opened door like inch frost around probe wire probe gasket door etc wire enters across gasket no way gasket going seal perfectly around wire wireless one might go right thing sitting outside freezer door power failure might use see interior temperature without constantly opening door
ordered two unit one deep freezer one freezer basement refridgerator one deep freeze worked great one mood swing temperature may flucuate degree matter minute caused false alarm first week threw one

oxidized using turned copper color
bought started leaking yesterday cold water one leaking hose touched look like glue something came hose hot water one isn looking good either weird middle length hose
ordered recommended use washer prevent water leak however one stripped easily put one old hose back
complaint product made item inside smell like plastic chemical used arm hammer refresher also left door open day perhaps clean extensively get rid smell ended returning
first sight loved function cool glass front blue led light overall look impressive classy hr drink put still little cooler tap water let disappointed don know wrong another hassle send back find another one fit bill two star since main reason purchasing cool drink big disappointment
cool well enough adjusting thermostat unit condensation glass pane door haier customer service tried give physic lesson rather acknowledge door bad seal
thing hold lot shelf tend bend towards middle sometimes bottle fall rearranging adding shelf also not get cold kind ridiculous chill drink little want drink ice cold doesn come close although saw another reviewer said adjusted popping temperature knob adjusting screw going try see help
one lasted since workes great not fridge keep beverage cold second one purchased august broke september getting fixed haier nightmare not mid october still not gotten replacement haier among worst customer service ever dealt want gamble unit might work might not cheap work getting great value break good luck
purchased local store immediately knew wouldn work tv room noise compressor make much noise hear bedroom across hallway would get way trying normal conversation tv room going back
year stopped hot inside soooo per year buying replacement locally
read review cold get not cold enough one reviewer said chiller wine doesn need cold well packaging show filled can coke owner manual doesnt give temperature range beyond max min bet people see beer soda fridge may not job well
thing broke month never really got drink cold anyway chiller refrigerator get something else
owned previous model lasted year compressor failed still warantee rule would cost fixed buy new one liked look old one alot looked glass front fridge didn find much weren wine fridge shelving can ended buying newer model since could find knowing might last year neither cool well enough cool pop beer better cooling bottom not store food hoping new one would identical old one actually worse shelving spacers horrible make real irregular store can bottom level way tall can next level short ended removing shelf make work thing hated worst replaced normal white light come open door old model cheap horrible blue led light doesn turn ever make bottled beer look like blue milk star war going put electrical tape cover light rather no light ugly blue light minus light look good shelve spacing horrible cooling
older model haier beverage fridge kept beer extremely cold even hot degree summer disappointed even milder fall day replacement unit simply not compare not measure precise temperature yet beverage mildy cold best
guess keep getting don see much choice short buying another humidifier don last long get cruddy stop wicking moisture not impressed
showed model humidifier didn fit longer skinner one fit model didn come box like usually filter mailing envelope don packaging box double check truely correct model number
filter hard find store ended buying online filter not last long would get moldy pretty quick even following direction cleaning ended getting filterless humidifier
made big mistake buying humidifier not spare part find online also use oil make work harder cold research find one easily find spare part filter use oil better performance
want monitor room floor house work fine put outside house home station loos ability connect point
additional unit work great remote temperature actual unit measure temperature not humidity package sealed clam shell labeled temperature humidity however item included inside temperature unit actual device not say hygro front expect manufacturer packaging error could use temperature unit cost return shipping not worth hassle return
compared filter included humidifier purchased poorer quality addition clean filter signal came within month didn even get season long run costly use product
pulled box started ripping
item poor quality material workmenship also overpriced item different pictured description not reorder
filter not wick well competing brand must replace often design ineffective
got since could not find local store hdc filter essick well don wick water well even humidifier additive prevent mold mildew growing mold mildew within week always clean humidifier change find real essick brand one worked year without problem
