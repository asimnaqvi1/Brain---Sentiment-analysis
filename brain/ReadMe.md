## :key: Prerequisites  

## 1. Environment   

 __Hardware Requirements__

Following hardware requirements are needed for smooth deployment of the software â€“
1. Hosted Server with the following configurations:
  32 GB+ RAM, 1 TB+ HDD, 250 GB+ SSD, 16 GB+ Graphics Card.  

2. Local System with the following configurations:
  8 GB+ RAM, 500 GB+ HDD, 4 GB+ Graphics Card, Network Interface Card.  
 
3. Printer  

  __Software Requirements__  
  
  Following software requirements are needed to set-up a favourable environment for the software â€“  
  
1. Hosted Server should have the following software:  
  Python 3.7 or above  
  MySQL 5.6 or above  
  Anaconda (Spyder)  
  
2. Local System should have the following software:
   Any Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE, Microsoft Edge, etc.)
   MS-Excel or Google Docs
   Adobe PDF Viewer  
   
The computational power is the most important dependency of the software. If the computation power of the environment provided for the software is high, the performance of the software will abruptly increase in a similar proportion.
