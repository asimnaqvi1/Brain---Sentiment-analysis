{"rating":4.0,"review":"This seems to work pretty well. Took me about 15 minutes to install (and that included finding my step-ladder). The switch is a bit flimsy, but it's not horrid. It's not going to heat your whole house, or even your basement, but every little bit helps and it's better than pumping the hot air into the backyard.\n\nNote, that there is a gravity flap on plastic flap which I assume is there in case you let the lint filter get clogged up. However, it doesn't take much pressure for that flap to be pushed up which means that about 25% of the heated air is going to escape outside no matter what position the switch is in. I would not suggest taping that flap down though...just don't be shocked on a cold morning if you see a little heated air coming from your outside dryer vent."}

{"rating":5.0,"review":"Alan Gregerman believes that innovation comes from viewing problems from different and fresh perspectives.  In The Necessity of Strangers, he tells short, simple stories to help free us from current, legacy views of the problem at hand.  He then provides a toolbox containing practical exercises - to stretch our thinking, to collaborate more effectively, to find strangers - all focused on getting us to view problems from different perspectives.  The Necessity of Strangers is a quick read that I keep on the desk as a constant reminder to seek novel views from new sources.  Like matter to anti-matter, The Necessity of Strangers is the perfect and completing complement to his earlier Surrounded by Geniuses.  Gil Miller, Chief Technology Officer, Noblis"}

{"rating":4.0,"review":"I will start by saying I live in Arizona.  Even then, it gets pretty cold in the winter.  Our winters also tend to be fairly dry, ESPECIALLY when using artificial heat in the house.  This vent does two things.  First, it adds heat to the house.  Second, it adds much needed moisture to the air.  When doing several loads of laundry the warmth and moisture is noticeable and much appreciated.  My only complaint is the actual construction of the unit leaves something to be desired.  The plastic has gaps and the air deflector does not fit as tight as I would like.  I do appreciate being able to capture the warm, moist air that might otherwise be lost outside in the winter.  Overall a good (but not great) product.  Would I buy it again?  If I couldn't find something built better, yes."}
{"rating":5.0,"review":"With talk constantly of \"working your network\" and leveraging your friendships, we lose the importance of expanding our friendships beyond a comfort zone:  to strangers.  Strangers are intimidating, may not want to be engaged, but are valuable to expand your universe and world view.\n\nOnce I went to a conference (as a junior person) with some executives from my company.  The executives interacted with each other, and with some people who worked at another location for the same company.  I leveraged my contacts to meet others at the conference, and just downright introduced myself to people.  I was far better at solidifying new business contacts than people who had far more experience than I, only because I was more gregarious and wanted to meet others.\n\nGregerman expands on this concept very well, and points out the many advantages of dealing with \"new blood\" as opposed to the same old people.\n\nWell written with good examples, \"The Necessity of Strangers\" is an important book for someone looking to expand beyond their sphere and learn from, and teach, others."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"Seriously! We always get this career advice \"you gotta know the right people\", but no one else ever talked about the \"necessity of strangers\" in a successful professional life. Strangers are a necessity because of their differences and what they know that we don't know.\n\nThe author has described his work as Explore, Connect, Innovate, Grow...a simple 4 word approach each of which is self-explanatory in the context of professional growth. It is \"Innovate\" area where strangers can help you most by providing an objective opinion and being able to challenge you to think differently, and drive you out of your comfort zone.\n\nFurther, the author compares the small limits of exploring only within your network by comparing the magic number of \"150 active connections of an averagely connected person\" with the overall population of strangers i.e. 7 billion.\n\nAlmost all the chapters have some \"key points to remember\" which you may find redundant if you read management and leadership books, but overall the text does not get boring or mundane since there are small stories and anecdotes to draw comparisons and analogies.\n\nHowever, the key lesson learned is that interaction with strangers will always help you to fill the knowledge gap which you or your own existing network may not be able to fill. So, one need to keep expanding his network and seek their help to innovate and grow."}

{"rating":4.0,"review":"This was really easy to install and took me all of 10 or so minutes.  Most of that was spent wrestling with my drier hose.  Since the air is already being vented into the laundry room there's no issue.  When summer comes around I may have to take the product off.  The unit itself has gaps in the plastic.  I may have my husband seal it with some caulking or we may just remove it in the warmer weather.\n\nSince we live in such an arid climate this product is perfect!  It keeps the back of the house warm while the drier is going and adds much needed humidity to the air.  In climates that aren't a desert I'd be cautious, as it does put out a good amount of humidity.\nI don't feel as bad using the drier rather than my drying rack while using this product."}

Lots of heat into the house, and no lint or excess moisture.  Everyone's house is different, so the moisture level may be a problem for some.  We took a hosiery knee-high stocking, and cut off most of the sock portion.  The elasticized portion (part that holds the knee-high near the knee) is the perfect size for fitting around the product's filter.  We sewed shut the other (cut-off) end.  Now we scrape lint out of the stocking and the product filter once every few days, and have no problems - only lots of \"free\" heat."}

There are gaps in the seams so not all of the dryer exhaust is directed by the Heat Keeper, some leaks out the seams and some leaks to outside. Another criticism that I have is that the screen is not very fine and for some reason is harder to clean than other dryer filters.\n\nNeither this device nor my old one does a great job of containing dust and lint. While a lint catching bag might be able to be tied over the exhaust on this one, I haven't tried that.

{"rating":4.0,"review":"Author Alan Gregerman, ([...] a business consultant and adjunct professor at Georgetown University offers eight pages of additional resources at the end of his fascinating book, saying, \"..these books articles, and websites,,,have formed an essential part of the mix that became 'The Necessity of Strangers.' You might say that I started with a large pot and a simple idea, threw in some water, and a few stones, and then wandered around looking for ideas, insights, and perspectives from a world filled with strangers.\" As you can tell, he includes the authors of books, articles, and websites, as well as ordinary people he encounters in the course of performing the small and large duties of life, in his definition of stranger inspiration. His business audience (Jossey-Bass) is very familiar with the former. Coming out of MBA programs, they look for help from books and articles all the time. It is the latter source of fresh thinking that they may, apart from surveys and polls. ignore. He also points out the importance of the fact that in many interactions, the parties are strangers. Smart business people take this into consideration and make every effort to establish relevant common ground. This seems obvious, but it is a significantly different way of thinking about customer service, collaboration, personnel relations, technological change, innovation, and leadership. The book is well-written, well-organized, and peppered with interesting examples, but it mainly argues for a change in attitude, and if you are a bottom-line business type looking for a quick, ready-made prescription to solve your problems, you may be disappointed. There are no charts or graphs or results of studies. Instead the author offers a road map and directions to set you off on your own journey. If you accept his challenge, he will be the first of a legion of strangers who will transform the human landscape around you."}

{"rating":5.0,"review":"I am a believer in Alan Gregerman.  I have enjoyed his blogs, lectures and books for several years.  Alan offers fun and practical guidance on not only getting the most out of our work, but out of our lives.\n\nAlan encourages us to get out of the comfort zone.  When faced with an urgent problem, most of us buckle down, bring in our closest advisors, lock the doors, order in dinner and make very important decisions.  Alan argues that we need to get out of the office, walk around and see what other great companies are doing.\n\nWhy?  In his latest offering, Alan reminds us the importance of strangers in our lives and the companies and organizations where we work.  In this Facebook world we live in, where many of us may have thousands of friends, Alan reminds us that friends can only get us so far..they are often reflections of ourselves.  While these might be comforting in a scary, for us to grow we must get out of the comfort zone in order to reach  our full potential?\n\nWe are a society that worships great ideas and often think that you must be brilliant like a Jobs or Zuckerberg.  Alan reminds us that most great ideas are borrowed from strangers and that the answers to our problem might be right and front of us.  He references  the Census, a process remained unchanged for nearly two centuries, and how it was improved by learning from our friends at UPS . That ITunes is merely a takeoff of The Great Library in Alexandria.  That most new drug discoveries are not being uncovered in isolated laboratories, but in faraway places that have treated these diseases for hundreds of years.\n\n99% of all ideas embrace the brilliance in the world around us. Curiosity. Humility. Respect.  While we all cannot be brilliant, we all can be curious, humble and respectful.  It is these arrows we need in quivers to reach our full potential,"}

It was when there was a constant flow of 'strangers' that I stayed on my toes and my mind was sharp.\n\nBeing in the 'back' now, I'm not as exposed to clients, internal or external, so this book is actually very timely for me.\n\nGregerman organizes the book into 3 parts. The first is Framework that explains why we need 'strangers' and the second part is 'Practice' in how it can work and it makes up the bulk of the book. The final part is Possibilities which is almost superfluous compared to the previous parts but it was like a reward of sorts.\n\nVery well done."}

I installed this rather quickly and sealed things up well.\n\nOn my test run, I noticed that warm, moist air was blowing right through the vent. Granted, much of the air was deflected outside, so it is better than just dumping all the air into your house.\n\nAlso, I felt that the lint screen was inadequate. The mesh isn't fine enough to catch the small pieces of lint that make it into the vent. The screen really might as well not even be there.\n\nSo, I'm back to doing what I did before: remove the duct from the outside vent, point it inward during the winter, and plug up the exterior vent with some insulation."}

It is a safety feature so when the screen gets plugged up, air can still vent. Under normal operation, my bypass door is closed or mostly closed directing the majority of the air into my house. Some reviews comment on the screen also. The screen openings are on the larger side, I would say it is like a window screen. Yes it does blow a tiny bit of lint into the room.

{"rating":4.0,"review":"Common sense and openmindedness are at the heart of Alan Gregerman's tome in praise of strangers. In clear and affable fashion, Gregerman guides his readers in an almost Socratic manner to embrace the insights and wisdom that are available to us once we look beyond the known.\n\nOddly -- or fortuitously -- enough, you and I are engaging in one of the practices he suggests in his book. One of the hallmarks of Amazon is its growing library of peer reviews and images. We don't know each other, and yet you paused in your consideration of this book to find out what earlier readers thought about it. And this is not a one-way street; there's every chance that you may use the \"comment\" function to add a question or other thought that would transform this from one person's observations and reflections into a conversation.\n\nMeantime, back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/The-Necessity-of-Strangers-The-Intriguing-Truth-About-Insight-Innovation-and-Success\/dp\/1118461304\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Necessity of Strangers: The Intriguing Truth About Insight, Innovation, and Success<\/a>. Gregerman begins with context, reviewing reasons for the common mistrust of strangers before illustrating how small even the largest personal network is likely to be. The nod to Socratic method begins with him asking readers to think about effective ways of gathering information, improving product, and thoroughly understanding our underlying mindset -- why we think the way we do, and how we can stretch ourselves beyond the status quo.\n\nAfter exploring context, which he calls framework, Gregerman asks readers to consider how to translate interacting with strangers from abstract to concrete: using these new relationships to spur innovation, collaboration, leadership, and customers, both existing and new (yet more \"strangers\"). Before setting us loose on a newly inviting world, Gregerman provides a succinct toolkit of strategies and techniques that we can begin using in everyday situations, as well as ways to spur our thinking and reflection.\n\nHe makes many thought-provoking points, and I believe they are best read in sequence. In fact, if you have an e-reader, you may want to buy the digital version so that you can highlight and annotate particularly salient thoughts.\n\nHowever, it is worth touching on the four guiding principles that are at the heart of this book. \"Humility--the belief that we don't know everything and that we can always be better at the things that matter most. Curiosity--our innate gift for being open to new ideas, new people, and new possibilities. Respect--the belief that everyone matters and that we learn and grow by engaging other people on their own terms. Purpose--our reason for being that guides our efforts to learn and grow.\"\n\nAlthough most of  Gregerman's examples and prescriptions deal with the workplace, they are readily applicable to life beyond the office, and even to one's own reflective practice. Indeed, one of the overarching principles is to seek out differences -- different outlooks, different areas of expertise, and even different lands -- and almost immediately to build human bridges of commonality. Particularly dear to my heart is his repeated statement that travel enriches the traveler and brings the world closer. In that vein, if you'd like, please do feel free to treat this review as the start of a conversation."}

{"rating":4.0,"review":"As a former job seeker 2 times over, I was told again and again to build my network and rely on that network of friends and close contacts to help me in my job search. It makes a lot of sense and it's what you're told again and again.\n\nMany job seekers in organizations I joined were on LinkedIn, but they didn't want to link to anyone that they did not know well enough that they would not give them a stellar recommendation. The thinking is, don't link in with anyone who might not have a stellar reputation or they might drag down your reputation. I can see that point, but if I met you at a networking event and you seem reasonably nice and helpful, why not link in with you? Why be so suspicious? If I make it clear to others in my network who might inquire about someone I'm linked with, why not be completely candid and say \"I met them in a networking event and they seemed nice, but I haven't worked with them before so I can't vouch for their work habits or reliability\". How often do you really get asked about someone in your LinkedIn network anyway?\n\nThis book served to encourage my more open-minded view of growing my network. I wouldn't link with someone I knew nothing about, but if you've met them and have a positive impression why not offer to help them?\n\nIt is important to know what this book defines as a \"stranger\" as you begin to read. Most of us think of strangers as someone we know nothing about. The author broadens this to include people we think we know well but really don't. Or someone we know very casually. I wouldn't categorize these types of people as \"strangers\" but I think it makes a better book title to say \"The Necessity of Strangers\" than \"The Necessity of Acquaintances and Strangers\". The latter title would be more accurate, but I guess it doesn't have the concise sizzle for selling books.\n\nThe book is an interesting concept. Opening yourself to insights and possibilities offered by people who have been raised in a different environment\/culture is a good idea. Even just listening to viewpoints from others could help you consider avenues you did not consider earlier and help lead to greater success in your personal and business life.\n\nAll in all, I consider this a good book. It encourages thinking beyond your immediate circles which is good encouragement for those of us who are New Englanders and tend to stick to our circles rather than venturing out and listening to new ideas."}

{"rating":5.0,"review":"As I began to read this book, I was again reminded of how deceptively complicated the word \"stranger\" is. It could refer to someone we have never heard of, of course, but it could also refer to someone we have met or heard about. We know their name but nothing else about them. Then there is another type of \"stranger\": someone we think we know well but really don't. We have false assumptions, a mindset, about who they are and aren't, what they can and can't do, and whether or not they would be willing to provide or receive assistance.\n\nAlan Gregerman wrote this book to explain how and why - with all due respect to the importance of one's family members, friends, and associates -- it is imperative to engage, learn from, and collaborate with strangers. \"People who are very different from us are essential to our growth and success as individuals and organizations.\" Just as Henry Chesbrough has devised an open business model, it could be said that Gregerman offers an open people model. How so?\n\n\"Each day we pass by more than one hundred people that could change our lives but we never make the time or effort to connect. The best way to solve any challenge or create any new opportunity is to begin by being curious about the world around us and realize that it is filled with remarkable people, insights, and possibilities.\" Nonetheless, there are those false assumptions and, perhaps, at least some concern about being rejected and feeling embarrassed or even foolish.\n\nHe suggests a new paradigm individuals and organizations \"wise enough\" to incorporate exploration and openness in their DNA. Here's its formula:\n\nBusiness and Personal Success =\nWhat I Already Know +\nMy Knowledge or Understanding Gap +\nA Stranger (or Strangers) Who Can Fill It\n\nHis citation of one of my favorite Charles Kettering quotations is dead-on:\n\n\"Where there is an open mind there will always be a frontier.\"\n\nGregerman devotes a great deal of attention to explaining how to develop the necessary mindset, one that embraces rather than recoils from exploration and openness. There are four core principles that provide its foundation: humility, curiosity, respect, and purpose. For those who are especially reluctant to become explorers of what is -- for them -- not only unfamiliar but perhaps terrifying territory, I presume to suggest one other: the courage to which Jack Dempsey refers when explaining that \"champions get up when they can't.\"\n\nThese are among the passages that caught my eye:\n\no Questions that strangers can help to answer (Page 9)\no The Race to the South Pole (20-28)\no What Science Tells Us (30-39)\no From Mindset to Guiding Principles (51-56)\no Helicopters. Hairstyles and Cars That Won't Collide (64-73)\no Finding the Right Strangers (78-84)\no Recognizing the Genius in Everyone (89-93)\no Rethinking Employee Engagement (96-103)\no Why Collaborate? (110-118)\no The New World of Customers (131-134)\no Understanding and Empowering Strangers (138-143)\no The Promise of Strangers (152-155)\no Changing the Game (158-163\no Getting Past the First Bite (174-176)\no Essential Tools for Implementation (189-201)\n\nWhen concluding his book, Alan Gregerman acknowledges the difficulty while stressing the importance of \"taking the first step\" toward understanding the potential importance of strangers to us and (yes) our potential importance to them. He observes, \"As humans we have the amazing ability to be open and to dream, imagine, explore, learn, connect, share, collaborate, innovate, and grow, to go big instead of going home. So get out there and find the stranger or the [strange] idea that could change your life.\" Who knows? We may be that stranger or have that idea that someone else needs. Nothing ventured...."}

It is a great mix of ideas and memorable examples of his insights in action.\n\nHis newest book, The Necessity of Strangers, builds on that previous body of knowledge and delves further into a critical dimension of his innovation research about the power of making connections outside of one's group to discover alternative approaches to addressing a challenge.  The book is full of excellent examples of individuals and organizations tackling challenges by seeking ideas and insights from \"strangers\".  Alan borrows heavily from personal experience which enriches the storytelling aspect that makes his writing so accessible.\n\nIf you have not seen Alan teaching his ideas or present to an audience, I would highly recommend it.

He recently presented the ideas from The Necessity of Strangers to a large audience of executives at our firm that left people talking, engaged, and energized.\n\nI highly recommend his books and Alan's live presentations."}
{"rating":3.0,"review":"In a breezy, conversational book, Gregrerman implores the reader that a \"growth\" mindset predicted on recognizing the gaps in one's personal\/business plans and the willingness to reach out to strangers to learn from and fill that gap - is a dependable way to innovate\/grow.  For a book that is billed as \"counterintuitive\" and \"provocative\", that advise may seems fairly formulaic.  Nevertheless, the ample use of anecdotes and some personal experiences are used to illustrate some simple (to understand, at least) techniques that can reduce one's reluctance to reach out and collaborate with \"strangers\".  The message is elegant, simple, and can be quite useful - one wishes that the editing was a little stricter (with about 200 pages, the message is amplified many times in the book) and more careful in some of the recommendations (some brilliant ones related to orientation of new hires get mixed with not-so-great ones regarding promotions).  With ample references to other pop psych books on incentives, motivation and leadership, Gregerman provides a potentially powerful message to reframe one's approach on growth."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"For a number of years, I've had the 'Square Box' dryer vent diverter (also sold by Amazon, Ace Harware and Home Depot). The square type often fell apart when the lint screen was removed for cleaning. The diverter flap hasn't worked for some time.\n\nYes, the Dunda Jafine model is a definite improvement, although the construction remains too fragile IMO. I would gladly pay a small premium for a more solid unit.\n\nAlso, while the lint screen is very easy to remove, it also very course and will likely dump a fair amount dust back into your basement or utility room -- I plan to experiment with placing a nylon stocking over the screen.\n\nI also used metal clamps rather than the nylon tie wraps provided. I managed to fastened the diverter to the basement wall with a set of 3M Velcro-like fastening strips. The fastener adhesive would not stick to the concrete wall so I used Gorilla glue for the one strip.\n\nTreat this unit gently when flipping the flap back an forth. Make sure that no lint is blocking the movement (I think that's what did in my old diverter). It's a always good idea to clean it with each load of clothes just as you would the dryer lint screen.\nWill provide an update in a few months if anything changes.\n\nUPDATE 18 MONTHS LATER -- I had to replace the unit as the small trap door on the flap had become detached and lost. This meant that some warm air would come back into the basement in the 'Summer' setting.

{"rating":4.0,"review":"In this book, the author argues that strangers are an essential part of innovation and that to truly cultivate creativity and innovation we need to be open to new ideas, meeting strangers and learning from different cultures and disciplines outside of our own culture or discipline. The author illustrates this point through a variety of case studies in both business and everyday life to demonstrate how contact with strangers can be helpful for sparking innovation. While the case studies are interesting the author doesn't really explain how to implement these ideas. This is a good book to read to inspire you to be open to learning from other people, but while the author provides a couple of ideas on how to do that, for the most part what he discusses is shared as ideas as opposed to really examining how to implement these ideas meaningfully.

{"rating":3.0,"review":"This item does what it's intended for, and does it moderately well. It allows you to redirect the heat from your dryer into your home instead of the outside in the cold months. Unfortunately, there is a significant design flaw, which makes little sense to me. I'll get into that at the end.\n\nFirst, it's cheap. It's molded plastic that is folded in half to make a tube shape and fit the flapper inside the box. Unfortunately, mine doesn't fold completely and the natural stress in the plastic makes it slightly not circular. This isn't a problem for connecting tubing, but it is a problem for the flapper, as it doesn't seat fully in the outside-flowing tube, so it allows cold air in. Second on the cheap scale are the zip ties it comes with. They are a step up from your standard single-use zip ties, as they have a lever to unlatch and expand them. However, the lever is impossible to push without taking the whole thing off and getting a pair of pliers on both sides of the zip, so it's pointless. Use a standard metal worm clamp instead.\n\nThe lint trap is useless: Take a stocking or cut off pantyhose and fit it over the end instead of the lint filter, like you probably do on your washer outlet. It's a much better filter.\n\nNow to the biggest design flaw, which I can only partially try to explain: There is a hole in the flapper, with a small flimsy inner flapper covering it. The effect is that when the flapper is up, to redirect hot air into your home, much of it is still pushed outside. And when it is in the other position, moving air will pull it open and suck out inside air, and\/or push hot air into your home (I'm not sure which, as it's winter now and I don't want to test it right now). My only guess why this inner flapper exists at all is that it is to make up for the poorly closing main flapper, so you don't get stagnant moist air hanging out in the section between the \"heat keeper\" and your outside vent. The effect it has is that the heat keeper doesn't rully redirect air, is leaky, and forces you to mount it in one specific orientation, otherwise the inner flapper will hang open and let in outside air.\n\nTLDR: It works, but leaks and could be better, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a better option made anymore."}

I would guess that about a fourth of the air escapes to the exterior in winter.  This means that I don't see 25% of the savings I had hoped for.  To look on the bright side, I am still saving 75% of the warm, humid air, so I would buy this product again.  However, I would prefer a product of better quality, even if it cost more."}

{"rating":3.0,"review":"The stated premise of the book, that strangers can improve your insight, innovation, and success, is true and is a relevant topic.  Gregerman presents a genial book that I wanted to like. OK, I did like it, but was still left disappointed because it didn't really deliver what it promised.  This isn't really a book about strangers, or being open to the influence of strangers, it's about openmindedness in general.  That's a fine topic too, but one that I have already read and thought extensively about.  That is why I was excited to find a book that would delve deep into one aspect of that -- openmindedness toward strangers.  Alas, this did not deliver.  IF you are looking for a fun and light, but still useful, book on openmindedness, in general, you should be very pleased.  This book offers a shallow look at many dimensions of openmindedness.\n\nEarly on, Gregerman writes, \"It may seem counterintuitive that strangers are to be embraced rather than ignored or avoided, but they are a necessity -- precisely because of their differences and what they know that we don't know; their objectivity and ability to be open and honest with us about the things that really matter; and their capacity to challenge us to think very differently about ourselves, the problems we face, and the nature of what is possible.  Finding and engaging the right strangers has the power to make all of us more complete, compelling, innovative, and successful.\"  This is exactly what I wanted, but Gregerman doesn't go into details on this.  He basically just tells us to talk with people.  Very general.  Indeed, the first chapter, Necessity, would have made a great article or Kindle Short, as that is where the heart of the idea is.  It's a great chapter in an otherwise average book.\n\nIn chapter 4, Innovation, Gregerman tells us to ask ourselves these 8 questions:  What's our best thinking to date?  What's the best thinking in our industry?  What's the best thinking in other industries?  What's the best thinking from popular culture?  What's the best thinking in other cultures?  What's the best insight from nature?  What's the best insight from science?  What are the best possibilities from science fiction?  OK, good questions, and Gregerman gives each a paragraph telling us why it is a good question, but does not give guidance on how to actually answer the questions.\n\nGregerman really stretches the definition of stranger.  At one point he uses fish as a \"stranger\" and discusses how the schooling behavior of fish led to innovations in accident avoiding cars.  Really, fish as strangers?  Isn't this really about openmindedness in general, and not openmindedness to strangers specifically?  Gregerman explicitly sidesteps the issue of strangers by stating that his approach is \"driven by the reality that in many ways almost all of us are strangers.\"  So, are we talking about openness to strangers, or about openness to people in general?  Why did the title of this book not refer to openmindedness rather than strangers?\n\nSome other books also offer insight into what strangers have to offer.  Check out Give And Take, by Adam Grant, which has more to offer than this book does, even though the premise is a bit different.  The Geography of Happiness may also be worth a look, though it is primarily about personal benefit, not business; but of course, these are entwined.  Another book, that Gregerman refers to is Carol Dweck's Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, which is specifically about openmindedness and closemindedness.\n\nGregerman seems like someone I would love to meet in person and talk with.  Really wish that he had examined the stated topic in more detail so that I could leave a more enthusiastic review.  Gergerman's last paragraph is a good summation of his book, so I present it here.  If this is what you actually want to read about, rather than an in-depth look at strangers, then you should enjoy this book:  \"Use these resources as a starting point for stretching your thinking or as a call to action to look in new places for ideas that could make a real difference to you and your organization.  Then commit to the regular habit of picking up a book or ebook, reading a magazine or blog, or watching a movie or TV show that takes you off of your well-beaten path -- not because everyone else around you is doing so, but because it might take you to a new and remarkable place where the possibility of a breakthrough awaits.\""}

{"rating":3.0,"review":"In  this engaging, readable book, author Gregrerman argues that business and personal growth come when we are open to interacting with strangers. This advice isn't especially new; as the author notes, Granovetter's concept of \"weak ties\" has become familiar. However much I wanted to like this book, I found it hard to identify insights that were truly new and novel and the recommendations, in some cases, impractical.\n\nFor instance, on page 26, the author suggests tips to create a plan for success. It's pretty standard: set an objective, develop a plan and so on. One step, \"Find strangers to fill those [knowledge] gaps,\" makes a lot of sense; it's the essential premise of networking. But these days, getting strangers to share information requires fairly sophisticated networking skills.\n\nWhile the book's premise relates to the importance of strangers, a good part of content is about overcoming resistance to people who might seem to have nothing to teach us. The issue here doesn't seem to be about strangers but about topics related to stereotyping and false appearance. It's important to differentiate true strangers from those we meet in a familiar setting that confers credibility.\n\nAdditionally, the people who gain most from dealing with strangers tend to transform the relationship so they're now dealing with friends and personal acquaintances. The stranger factor disappears! For instance, the author describes a meeting with a university administrator who becomes a mentor and advocate. Although the two were strangers initially, they met in a fairly structured situation that was conducive to creating a relationship, and at some early point they stopped being strangers\n\nPerhaps our real challenge is not about breaking down barriers with strangers, but deciding which strangers to approach and how to assess their input. Career changers are urged to seek help from experts in their industry, yet often the \"advice\" they get is inappropriate; however, these people can be valuable as informational resources when approached with carefully designed questions.\n\nIn the end, the stranger question becomes both simple and complex. Yes, we will grow by interacting with diverse people who are outside our inner circles. However, sometimes resistance to strangers can help us avoid traps, especially when we're paying or placing ourselves in a vulnerable position.\n\nFor instance, the author says he met his wife by connecting with strangers in a particularly clever way - offering a big reward to friends who'd set up an introduction. Sure, these women were strangers, but they were already connected through his own friends, creating an effective filter.\n\nThe toolkit at the book's end includes some useful but not entirely novel ideas. In my experience the best way to meet new people in a meaningful is to engage in some new activity. His idea to \"get out of the office\" is a good start, but what about joining a new gym or a new club, trying new networking events, or even taking a class that brings you in contact with people you wouldn't meet otherwise?\n\nOverall the book entertains.  You might have some interesting conversations and talking points when you share the examples But the title leads us to expect something that radically shifts our mindset ... sort of like what happens when we connect with strangers."}
{"rating":5.0,"review":"Most range cords are barely aduaqute for the amps they claim. This one is spot on and is great for anyone who likes to over do things like myself. The ones for sale at most home stores are for the \"typical\" install of 30-40 amps. This one is sized for a full 50 and it great because for my project I wanted to run a 50amp circuit to be used for other things like a welder. Although I am currently only using it to power a car charger that can at max pull 30amps. It's better to over size all the wiring which means less heat. Especially when you are charging a car for up to 10 hours."}
{"rating":5.0,"review":"Installs in 15 minutes...not necessarily easy because of the ducting issues behind the dryer.  The dryer needs to be carefully  pulled out so as to not pull apart the ducting.  All in all a great idea, although somewhat of a kluge effect. It does work well, but be advised you need a fan in the utility room in order of move the air out of the confined space.  A larger room would not need this help."}

{"rating":1.0,"review":"First let me start by saying, \"this product is extremely poorly made.\"  Secondly, it was advertised as coming with: \"Includes a 4-Inch by 8-Foot ProFlex UL 2158A dryer transition duct,\" which wasn't anywhere to be found.  This is made of very thin plastic and the parts do not fit together well so there are open seams which allow air (and lint) to escape into your room.  The damper is also poorly made and allows air to escape the unit into the \"closed\" duct so it isn't very effective.  Another negative aspect of this device is that there are no mounting brackets or fixtures for keeping this on or against your wall.  So please consider it's going to cost you more for mounting brackets, additional duct work, better clamps (comes with zip ties) and that this product doesn't work effectively.  I guess you've figured...I'm sending this back for a refund."}
{"rating":5.0,"review":"People are crying about quality - it's a dryer vent.  I've also seen (an removed) a lot cheaper ones, like the ones at the big box stores.\n\nIt's a little clumsy but works great - exactly as described.  Has a little flap in the main flap to blow off extra pressure (like if the screen builds up lint).  Seal up the edges with silicon or duct sealant if you don't like the very minor leaks.  Flap moves and locks well, and plastic housing is sufficiently thick.\n\nIf you're worried about the influence of outside air use an outside vent like the Lambro or Heartland.  You're dryer is going to leak air either way unless you use something that closes off the outside completely.  The only difference is you'll notice it at this junction before you notice it at the dryer but the same thing happens regardless.  It's not this devices fault."}

{"rating":5.0,"review":"I like business books that approach topics and issues  (even if they are obvious topics and issues) from a new perspective.  This book specifically addresses the need for us to overcome our natural, built-in aversion to dealing with \"strangers.\"  The books spends a lot of time demonstrating that this aversion is something that is part of the human make-up, and then shows how this aversion hinders our innovation, creativity, collaboration,  and ability to lead.  I read two or three business books per month, and none of them have yet addressed this interesting point of view in quite this way.  It seems like an obvious point, but this book really made me think about how to engage with \"strangers\" and I actually now find myself seeking out others and engaging in better conversation.  At a conference I recently went to, I actually found myself making an effort to meet other vendors to learn more deeply about what they do.  When we do this, we expand our horizons, get out of our limited point of view, and can innovate and lead better.  So, I gave the book five stars for presenting a new approach to something \"obvious\" and making a difference in the way I approach business.  I knocked it one star for being way too lengthy in some places (a typical business book problem these days).  But I gave it one star back for providing a \"Toolkit\" at the end of the book to help the reader apply the principles presented throughout the book.  This is a great idea and I wish every business book did this.  So, did I learn something? Yes.  Is it something I can apply that will make a difference? Yes.  Did I find a few \"a-ha!\" moments and did I find myself highlighting and taking notes?  Yes.  This is a business book that I can highly recommend."}
{"rating":2.0,"review":"Poorly engineered and manufactured.\n\nMine arrived with broken tabs. Tiny, tiny tabs whose purpose may serve to aid manufacturing and assembly but are too weak to keep the clamshell-style halves together. These tabs are so dramatically under-engineered they either failed in shipping or didn't survive assembly at the factory. Good thing this product comes with tie wraps to attach the dryer hose... I'll need them to keep this product from \"unhinging\". The \"pressure relief\" feature is silly (a second flap in the middle of THE flap). This \"feature\" activates with the lightest puff of air completely compromising any seal (I'm being generous suggesting the parts of this product actually align properly) and makes the choice of directing the majority of air either indoors or out moot. Unless you disable this 2nd flap (i.e. duct tape) the air goes where it wants to.\n\nHere's my biggest problem - no pride in work. Not in design... Not in engineering... Not in manufacture. This product appears to have been compromised by committee and bean counters to maximize profit, not to deliver a quality product with value."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"I find that the Dundas heat diverter works as designed. Yes, it is lightweight and can come apart but with a little tweaking it is well worth the cheap cost. Installation? I just screwed it to the wall.\n\nThe biggest complaint that people have is about the screen allowing lint to go through.  SOLUTION Pull off the screen cap, place a used dryer sheet over the opening, put the cap back on.  Now you've got a second, finer screen which, after two uses (dryer sheet length is twice the diameter) you dispose of it.\n\nMoisture accumulation in the laundry room is no problem in that it is a well heated and ventilated area. The moist hot air has plenty of opportunity to disperse and contribute to our comfort. With my gas heat going we have plenty of good use for the moisture.  Win Win. When summer comes I will probably bypass the whole thing connecting the flex tubes to each other making sure all heat goes outside. Yes, it has a flap but it's only about 95% coverage.\n\nI would use metal screw hose clamps on the tubing for maximum fit. That also helps pull the plastic housing together."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"Works great. Remember to install the device in the right direction. The arrow on the unit will direct you. Also, might be better if you bought two 4 inch metal screw clamps from the hardware store rather than using the plastic ties they send with the unit. I went to Lowes and bought another section of exhaust tubing to make the device rise above the dryer and then anchored it to the wall. Also, I cut some material from an a\/c filter to the exact shape of the filter screen for better air filtration. This is a nice device and cheap as anything can be. Good luck."}

{"rating":3.0,"review":"I installed this baby recently (I've owned it for awhile; just sat here in the box).  I found that, as many reviewers have said, that the side entry points for the 4\" dryer venting tubes are not a tight fit at all.  I tried to use the zip ties they provided (Uhh....guys, these are NOT clamps!) but they don't even go the entire distance around the 4\" tube!  So, since I had the product basically jammed between the venting coming out of the dryer and the venting to the outside of the house, I just duct taped around the edges.  No zip ties required.\n\nOne thing I found out after the fact:  The little flapper in my unit was not attached.  Yup, didn't figure this out until I had the thing \"installed\".  So, I had to take it apart, reach in and snap it in place.  I did what someone else recommended - put a used dryer sheet behind the removable lint filter. I only had the thing on \"open\" a day or two then it got super hot here in the mid-west, so it's all venting outside now.\n\nI look forward to a lint-free way to enjoy the heat I'm creating in the winter from my dryer.  I will update if things change; but you get what you pay for here."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"So refreshing to read something that provides unique insights into a subject area few authors have dared to explore. The authors young daughter piqued his interest in the subject and launched this noble literary endeavor. In an age that seems to be enamored in what we have in common - The Necessity of Strangers provides a landscape of confirmation about the value of the unfamiliar, difference, and things strange. A book that would be of interest to management consultants, marketing types and those involved in learning professions of all types. Like I said, I adored this work. I believe you will too."}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"Got it today, installed it and tossed a load of wet clothes in the dryer and turned it on with the damper set to blow into the house....Wow!  I never realized how much heat was being wasted just blowing through a hole in the wall!  If you have never seen one of these working it is just like a heating vent from a forced air furnace!  The actual construction of the whole thing is pretty cheap and a couple of ears molded onto it would have been nice for screwing it in place on the wall.  I drilled a hole inside at the back of it and secured it in place with a couple screws. It seems sturdy enough I guess, time will tell. ;-)"}
{"rating":4.0,"review":"When I first read through The Necessity of Strangers, it seemed to tell the same old stories about innovation that you see told over and over again. Yet another consultant out there making money telling clients to do this and do that to improve their business, where almost any action will help. Not much unique or valuable about those kinds of consultants.\n\nSo after skimming a few chapters I put the book on my unread books pile for a while and moved on to other books. When I picked the book up later, though, I was more impressed. I tried some of the practical suggestions Alan Gregerman gives at the end of his chapters, and they seemed to work. They were more than just gimmicks, but helpful tools.\n\nThat said, I'm still not sure which book most readers will experience. The trite rehash or the helpful guidance. Perhaps it's worth reading the book to find out."}
{"rating":5.0,"review":"I needed to replace an similar type unit.  It is square and has a square closure flap but I don't recall the name.  This unit is much better in design and more thoroughly thought out as to design and use.  The flap in this unit can be locked in place with the control\/set lever shown in photo.  So you can lock it open or closed, a problem with the other unit was the flap would fall between dryer loads and would have to be reset.  Plus this unit came with two nylon closures for the flex lines.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."}

{"rating":5.0,"review":"Definitely 5 stars.  I like everything about this book.  The size and weight of the book are perfect for what you'd want from a coffee table book on cigars.  Even the particular stock of the paper even gives it a rustic sophistication, again, matching what you'd expect from a cigar.  It is well written with plenty of substantive content on the production and appreciation of cigars (as opposed to blurb style content more fitting for an online lifestyle magazine.)  The photography is smartly done in its consistent style of large, numerous, richly detailed photos that, at the same time, are not over-stylized but still create a strong sense of immersion as you read through it.  The focus is primarily on the growth and assembly of cigars from their major production regions, and not so much on any particular brand or marketing of cigars, though it touches on everything to a degree.  I definitely recommend this."}

{"rating":3.0,"review":"ITS WHAT I WANTED BUT NOT INSTALLED YET"}
{"rating":3.0,"review":"The device does what it says, it keeps the warm moist air in the house when wanted.  The only problem is that lint filter is not that fine.  We took off the supplied lint filter and attached a cut off leg from a pair of pantyhose to the vent with a rubber band.  This works much better than the supplied lint trap as the pantyhose have a finer mesh and do not have to be cleaned as often."}
{"rating":2.0,"review":"I bought this unit to insert into the dryer's exhaust tubing in order to switch between the much better Indoor Lint Trap Filter I was also ordering, and the outside exhaust port (without using its included screen). The reviews on the Dundas unit were not good enough for me to use it exclusively as a filter trap, but as a diverter, yes. Great idea: exhaust heated air through a better lint filter into the basement during winter, exhaust heated air outdoors during summer by simply turning the lever. Great idea defeated: the manufacturer \"improved\" the unit by making a large hole in the diverter flap to prevent \"blow back\", thus defeating my purpose. To fix this problem, I cut out a round disc from a plastic lid and glued it onto the flap.\nA trip to my local hardware store for more ducting revealed that they had a better made unit (sans flap hole) with a lower price (and no shipping). The unit now serves my intended purpose, albeit at greater expense and more work."}
